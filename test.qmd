## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed) see @fig-test.

```{r}
#| label: fig-test
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(hp, mpg)) + geom_point()
```

random text see @sfig-test2.

```{r}
#| label: sfig-test2
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) + geom_point()
```

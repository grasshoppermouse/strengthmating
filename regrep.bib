Despite close links between the disciplines the in early 20th century, in the 21st century, the disciplines of demography and evolutionary biology largely operate independently of one another. There is, however, growing recognition of the gains that can be made by closer relationships between these disciplines. This volume aims to highlight to researchers interested in our own species what those gains might be, and to encourage further integration between disciplines. The volume also capitalises on that growing recognition, by incorporating chapters from those researchers at the cutting edge of the interdisciplinary field of evolutionary demography: showcasing the latest research in this small but vibrant field.

Associations between advanced maternal age and psychological distress in primiparous women, from early pregnancy to 18 months postpartum. BJOG 2012;119:1108\textendash 1116. Objective To investigate if advanced maternal age at first birth increases the risk of psychological distress during pregnancy at 17 and 30 weeks of gestation and at 6 and 18 months after birth. Design National cohort study. Setting Norway. Sample A total of 19 291 nulliparous women recruited between 1999 and 2008 from hospitals and maternity units. Methods Questionnaire data were obtained from the longitudinal Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study, and register data from the national Medical Birth Register. Advanced maternal age was defined as {$\geq$}32 years and a reference group of women aged 25\textendash 31 years was used for comparisons. The distribution of psychological distress from 20 to {$\geq$}40 years was investigated, and the prevalence of psychological distress at the four time-points was estimated. Logistic regression analyses based on generalised estimation equations were used to investigate associations between advanced maternal age and psychological distress. Main outcome measures Psychological distress measured by SCL-5. Results Women of advanced age had slightly higher scores of psychological distress over the period than the reference group, also after controlling for obstetric and infant variables. The youngest women had the highest scores. A history of depression increased the risk of distress in all women. With no history of depression, women of advanced age were not at higher risk. Changes over time were similar between groups and lowest at 6 months. Conclusion Women of 32 years and beyond had slightly increased risk of psychological distress during pregnancy and the first 18 months of motherhood compared with women aged 25\textendash 31 years.},

Full blood counts of whole blood showed higher levels of lymphocyte in male subjects. Lymphocyte subsets enumeration revealed higher NK cell counts in males and higher B cells in females. Cultured PBMC resulted in significant increases in B and total T cell percentages among females and NK cells among males. PHA stimulated significantly increased percentages of NK and total T cells in males and total activated T cells (CD69+) in females.

  abstract = {Objectives: To determine sex differences in the distribution of regional and total skeletal muscle (SM) using contiguous whole body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, and to examine the relations between fat free mass (FFM) and total and regional SM masses. Methods: A total of 20 Japanese college students (10 women and 10 men) volunteered for the study. FFM was measured by two compartment densitometry. Whole body MRI images were prepared using a 1.5 T scanner. Contiguous transverse images with 1.0 cm slice thickness were obtained from the first cervical vertebra to the ankle joints. All MRI scans were segmented into four components (SM, subcutaneous adipose tissue, bone, and residual tissues). In each slice, the SM tissue cross sectional areas (CSAs) were digitised, and the muscle tissue volume per slice was calculated by multiplying muscle CSA by slice thickness. SM volume units (litres) were converted into mass units (kg) by multiplying the volumes by the assumed constant density (1.041 mg/ml) for SM. Results: The SM distribution pattern (shape of curve) from the contiguous whole body slices was essentially similar for the two sexes, with two large peaks and three smaller peaks (arms excluded). However, the largest peak was observed at the upper portion of the thigh for women and at the level of the shoulder for men. Men had larger (p{$<$}0.01) total and regional SM mass than women. All regional SM masses correlated highly (r = 0.90\textendash 0.99, p{$<$}0.01) with total SM mass. A strong positive correlation was observed between FFM and total and regional SM masses in both sexes (women, r = 0.95; men, r = 0.90; all p{$<$}0.01). As FFM increased, there was a corresponding increase in SM/FFM ratio for all subjects (r = 0.86, p{$<$}0.01). Conclusions: Sex differences in total SM/FFM ratio and regional SM distributions are associated with the degree of absolute FFM accumulation in men and women.},

The first objective concerns the approaches that evolutionary cognitive archaeologists utilize to infer mind frames. These approaches (or methods) and the cognitive inferences they help the archaeologist make will be discussed chronologically from their earliest sightings in the archaeological literature. The second objective to be treated in this chapter concerns the mechanisms of cognitive evolution. Although natural selection is still considered to be the main mechanism behind cognitive evolution, other mechanisms that show promise have also been proposed and, as such, will be examined. The chapter concludes with a short discussion of the two chapters that follow this one and their contribution to the field of ECA.},

We then extend this argument to a reappraisal of the archaeological record, proposing that the exchange of cultural information between divergent groups may have facilitated the emergence of cultural innovation. We discuss the implications of this Divergence and Hybridization Model for considering the taxonomy of our lineage.},

We propose that the effect of expressing anger depends on the competitiveness of the negotiation situation. Specifically, when the negotiation situation balances cooperative and competitive elements, expressing anger elicits larger concessions than no anger, and responses are driven by cooperation-inducing strategic inferences (e.g., a perception that the anger expresser is tough and threatening). However, when the negotiation context is predominantly cooperative or predominantly competitive, expressing anger does not elicit larger concessions than no anger, and responses are driven by cooperation-inhibiting affective reactions (e.g., reciprocal anger and a desire to retaliate against the anger expresser). Results from two computer-mediated negotiation experiments using different negotiation scenarios, different manipulations of the competitiveness of the situation, and different subject populations supported our hypotheses.},

Data from focus group discussions with men and women in Nepal show that there are three spouse choice categories with differing levels of parental influence over mate choice, reinforcing that arranged and non-arranged are not dichotomous. Discussions also show that parents and offspring, especially sons, may be more aligned in in-law/mate preferences than expected, demonstrating the need to establish clear domains of parent\textendash offspring disagreement over spouse choice in the community before investigating fitness. Several social and financial benefits that are only available to arranged couples in this community were detected, and these benefits could compensate for any costs of not choosing a spouse independently. These benefits of arranged marriage are more salient for women than for men. These discussions indicate that predictions about the effects of spouse choice on fitness outcomes may differ for men and women and depend on community-specific socioeconomic benefits.},

The effects of these risks are disproportionately borne by women and their offspring\textemdash particularly those from communities of color. The prenatal period is an especially vulnerable period of fetal development, during which time women's experiences of stress can have long-lasting implications for offspring mental health. Importantly, there is a lack of focus on women's capacity for resilience and potential postnatal protective factors that might mitigate these intergenerational risks and inform intervention efforts. The present study examined intergenerational associations between women's prenatal stressors and child executive functioning and externalizing problems, testing maternal parenting quality and child sex as moderators, using a large, prospective, sociodemographically diverse cohort.MethodsWe used data from 1,034 mother-child dyads (64\% Black, 30\% White) from the Conditions Affecting Neurocognitive Development and Learning in Early Childhood (CANDLE) pregnancy cohort within the ECHO PATHWAYS consortium. Women's prenatal stressors included stressful life events (pSLE) and intimate partner violence (pIPV). Measures of child psychopathology at age 4\textendash 6 included executive functioning and externalizing problems. Parenting behaviors were assessed by trained observers, averaged across two sessions of mother-child interactions. Linear regression models were used to estimate associations between women's prenatal stressors and child psychopathology, adjusting for confounders and assessing moderation effects by maternal parenting quality and child sex.ResultsWomen's exposures to pSLE and pIPV were independently associated with child executive functioning problems and externalizing problems in fully-adjusted models. Maternal parenting quality moderated associations between pSLE and both outcomes, such that higher parenting quality was protective for the associations between women's pSLE and child executive functioning and externalizing problems. No moderation by child sex was found.DiscussionFindings from this large, sociodemographically diverse cohort suggest women's exposures to interpersonal violence and major stressful events\textemdash common for women during pregnancy\textemdash may prenatally program her child's executive functioning and externalizing problems. Women's capacity to provide high quality parenting can buffer this intergenerational risk. Implications for universal and targeted prevention and early intervention efforts to support women's and children's wellbeing are discussed.},

First, we review how bridewealth has been conceptualised across multiple disciplines, including the work of evolutionary human scientists. We then summarise our research grounded in residential ethnographic fieldwork data collected over a period of a year in a rural settlement in north-western Ghana. Feminist accounts on women's lived experiences throughout bridewealth practising societies point to their subordination. In some contexts, including northern Ghana, bridewealth is perceived as engendering women's oppression. To liberate women from patriarchal norms, some gender advocates call for undoing of the institution of the marriage payment. Nonetheless, the women who bear the brunt of gendered oppression and the men who derive patriarchal dividends from it are averse to this undoing discourse as the bridewealth normatively secures legitimacy for women. Undoing bridewealth may mean further rendering precarious women's status in the marital family. We conclude that rather than undoing the revered institution of bridewealth, there is need to build on culturally appropriate notions of communitarianism as encapsulated by the Ubuntu philosophy and indigenous systems such as the traditional courts for negotiating the rights of women.},

A provisioning ``dad'' loses fitness at the hands of nonprovisioning, mate-seeking ``cads.'' Recent models require exacting interplay between male provisioning and female choice to overcome this social dilemma. We instead posit that ecological change favored widespread improvements in male provisioning incentives, and we show theoretically how social obstacles to male provisioning can be overcome. Greater availability of energetically rich, difficult-to-acquire foods enhances female\textendash male and male\textendash male complementarities, thus altering the fitness of dads versus cads. We identify a tipping point where gains from provisioning overcome costs from paternity uncertainty and the dad strategy becomes viable. Stable polymorphic states are possible, meaning that dads need not necessarily eliminate cads. Our simulations suggest that with sufficient complementarities, dads can emerge even in the face of high paternity uncertainty.

  abstract = {Over the last ten years, there has been increased interest in the evolutionary origins of depressive phenomena. The current article provides a review of the major schools of thought that have emerged in this area. First, we consider important Darwinian explanations of depressed mood, including an integrative social risk hypothesis recently proposed by the authors. According to the social risk hypothesis, depression represents an adaptive response to the perceived threat of exclusion from important social relationships that, over the course of evolution, have been critical to maintaining an individual's fitness prospects. We argue, moreover, that in the ancestral environment, depression minimized the likelihood of exclusion by inducing: (i) cognitive hypersensitivity to indicators of social risk/threat; (ii) signaling behaviours that reduce social threat and elicit social support; and (iii) a generalized reduction in an individual's propensity to engage in risky, appetitive behaviours. Neurobiological support for this argument is also provided. Finally, we review three models that endeavour to explain the relationship between the adaptations that underlie depressed mood and clinically significant, depressed states, followed by a consideration of the merits of each.},

  abstract = {Recent discoveries relating depression to inflammation and immune function may help to solve an important evolutionary puzzle: If depression carries with it so many negative consequences, including notable costs to survival and reproduction, then why is it common and heritable? What countervailing force or compensatory advantage has allowed susceptibility genes for depression to persist in the population at such high rates? A priori, compensatory advantages in combating infection are a promising candidate, given that infection has been the major cause of mortality throughout human history. Emerging evidence on deeply rooted bidirectional pathways of communication between the nervous and immune systems further supports this notion. Here we present an updated review of the ``infection-defense hypothesis'' of depression, which proposes that moods\textemdash with their ability to orchestrate a wide array of physical and behavioral responses\textemdash have played an adaptive role throughout human history by helping individuals fight existing infections, as well as helping both individuals and their kin avoid new ones. We discuss new evidence that supports several key predictions derived from the hypothesis, and compare it with other major evolutionary theories of depression. Specifically, we discuss how the infection-defense hypothesis helps to explain emerging data on psychoimmunological features of depression, as well as depression's associations with a diverse array of conditions and illnesses\textemdash including nutritional deficiencies, seasonal changes, hormonal fluctuations, and chronic diseases\textemdash that previous evolutionary theories of depression have not accounted for. Finally, we note the potential implications of the hypothesis for the treatment and prevention of depression.},

  abstract = {In Chunhuhub, the Conquest is not a done deal. Unlike many small tropical towns, Chunhuhub in rural Quintana Roo, Mexico, has not been a helpless victim of international forces. Its people are descendants of heroic Mayans who stood off the Spanish invaders. People in Chunhuhub continue to live largely through subsistence farming of maize and vegetables, supplemented by commercial orchard, livestock, and field crop cultivation. They are, however, also self-consciously \`Omodernizing\'O by seeking better educational and economic opportunities. Political Ecology in a Yucatec Maya Community tells the story of Chunhuhub at the beginning of the twenty-first century, focusing on the resource management of plants and animals. E. N. Anderson and his Maya co-authors provide a detailed overview of Maya knowledge of and relationships with the environment, describing how these relationships have been maintained over the centuries and are being transformed by modernization. They show that the Quintana Roo Mayas have been working to find ways to continue ancient and sustainable methods of making a living while also introducing modern techniques that can improve that living. For instance, traditional subsistence agriculture is broadly sustainable at current population densities, but hunting is not, and modern mechanized agriculture has an uncertain future. Bringing the voice of contemporary Mayas to every page, the authors offer an encyclopedic overview of the region: history, environment, agriculture, medicine, social relations, and economy. Whether discussing the fine points of beekeeping or addressing the problem of deforestation, they provide a remarkably detailed account that immerses readers in the landscape. Mayas of the Yucat\textdaggerdbl n Peninsula have had more than their share of successes\~Nand some failures as well\~Nand as a study in political and cultural ecology, Political Ecology in a Yucatec Maya Community has much to tell us about tropical development and about the human condition. Their experience tells us that if we wish to have not only farms but also mahogany, wildlife, and ecotourism, then further efforts are needed. As Anderson observes, traditional Maya management, with its immense knowledge base, remains the best\~Nindeed, the only\~Neffective system for making a living from the Yucat\textdaggerdbl n\~Os harsh landscape. Political Ecology in a Yucatec Maya Community is a compelling testament to the daily life practices of modern peasant farmers that can provide us with clues about more efficient management techniques for the conservation of biodiversity worldwide.},

On the one hand, functionalist accounts posit that the status hierarchies that emerge within groups benefit those groups by providing order, coordination, and incentives for individual sacrifice. In contrast, critical accounts argue that status hierarchies are only loosely tied to merit, create divisions among individuals, foster mistrust, and hamper communication and collective success. The current chapter integrates these two opposing views by proposing a bounded functionalist perspective of status hierarchies. Specifically, we argue that group members strive to form functional hierarchies that will foster their collective success, but they are constrained in their ability to do so by the difficulties in allocating status based on merit and by the opposing force of individual self-interest.},

Some evidence suggested openness to experience could predict status, though this evidence was somewhat weaker. Agreeableness was found not to predict status attainment. To explain these findings, we use a recently proposed Micropolitics theory of status-organizing processes (Anderson and Kennedy, Research on managing groups and teams, Vol. 15, pp. 49\textendash 80, 2012), which argues that an individual's status is a product of both a group's judgments of which individuals deserve higher status, and of the individual's motivation and ability to seek higher status.

However, within species and populations, rates of biological aging (i.e., physical decline with age) vary across individuals. Understanding sources of variation in biological aging is therefore central to understanding the biodemography of natural populations. Here, we constructed a DNA methylation-based predictor of chronological age for a population of wild baboons in which behavioral, ecological, and life history data have been collected for almost 50 years (N = 277 blood samples from 245 individuals, including 30 who were longitudinally sampled). Consistent with findings in humans and model organisms [1\textendash 4], DNA methylation patterns exhibit a strong, clock-like association with chronological age, but individuals are often predicted to be somewhat older or younger than their known age. However, the two most robust predictors of lifespan described for this population\textemdash cumulative early adversity and social bond strength\textemdash do not explain this deviation. Instead, the single most predictive factor is male dominance rank: high-ranking males are predicted to be biologically older than their true chronological age, such that alpha males appear to be nearly a year older than their known age. Longitudinal sampling indicates that males who climb the social hierarchy subsequently look epigenetically ``older,'' likely reflecting the high energetic costs of rank attainment and maintenance in male baboons. Together, our results indicate that environmental effects on survival and epigenetic age can be disjunct, and that achieving high rank for male baboons\textemdash the best predictor of reproductive success\textemdash imposes physiological costs consistent with a ``live fast, die young'' life history strategy.},

Using a natural experiment from the colonization of Sub-Saharan Africa, this study aims to isolate the direct effect of large-scale changes to women's property rights from other IPV risk factors. The findings show that more equitable marital property rights could both reduce the incidence of IPV and also increase women's own condemnation of the violence. The empirical estimates suggest that legal property reform could render at least 12 million women less vulnerable to IPV across Sub-Saharan Africa.},

Evolutionary scholars are concerned with the fitness consequences of competition and economists are centrally concerned with the nature of competition: how the allocation of scarce resources is mediated by potentially complex forms of social interaction and conflicts of interest. We illustrate our argument by focusing on conceptual and empirical approaches to a topic of interest to economists and evolutionary scholars: polygynous marriage. In comparing conceptual approaches, we distinguish between those that emphasise the physical environment and those that emphasise the social environment. We discuss some advantages of analysing marriage through the lens of competitive markets, and outline some of the ways that economists analyse the emergence of rules governing the family. In discussing empirical approaches to polygynous marriage, we describe how a concern for informing contemporary policy leads economists to focus on the consequences of polygyny, and in particular we describe some of the ways in which economists attempt to distinguish causal effects from selection effects.},

The current project gleans data from across the ethnographic literature to investigate the prevalence of women hunting in foraging societies in more recent times. Evidence from the past one hundred years supports archaeological finds from the Holocene that women from a broad range of cultures intentionally hunt for subsistence.

Why have males in many animals evolved more conspicuous ornaments, signals, and weapons than females? How can such traits evolve although they may reduce male survival? Such questions prompted Darwin's perhaps most scientifically controversial idea--the theory of sexual selection. It still challenges researchers today as they try to understand how competition for mates can favor the variety of sex-dimorphic traits. Reviewing theoretical and empirical work in this very active field, Malte Andersson, a leading contributor himself, provides a major up-to-date synthesis of sexual selection. The author describes the theory and its recent development; examines models, methods, and empirical tests; and identifies many unsolved problems. Among the topics discussed are the selection and evolution of mating preferences; relations between sexual selection and speciation; constraints on sexual selection; and sex differences in signals, body size, and weapons. The rapidly growing study of sexual selection in plants is also reviewed. This volume will interest students, teachers, and researchers in behavioral ecology and evolutionary biology.},

Intuitively, reciprocity should evolve if past behavior conveys information about future behavior. But it is not straightforward to understand why this should be an outcome of evolution. Most evolutionary models assume that individuals' past behavior informs others about their stable social type (defector, cooperator, reciprocator, etc.), which makes it sensible to reciprocate. In this article, after describing the central source of difficulty in the evolutionary understanding of reciprocity, I put forward an alternative explanation based on a work by O. Leimar. It consists of taking into account the fact that the payoffs to individuals in social interactions can change through time. This offers a solution because individuals' past behavior then signals their payoffs, which also makes it sensible to reciprocate. Even though the overwhelming majority of evolutionary models implicitly endorse the social types mechanism, I argue that the social incentives mechanism may underlie reciprocity in humans.},

Depressed people often believe that their ruminations give them insight into their problems, but clinicians often view depressive rumination as pathological because it is difficult to disrupt and interferes with the ability to concentrate on other things. Abundant evidence indicates that depressive rumination involves the analysis of episode-related problems. Because analysis is time consuming and requires sustained processing, disruption would interfere with problem-solving. The analytical rumination (AR) hypothesis proposes that depression is an adaptation that evolved as a response to complex problems and whose function is to minimize disruption of rumination and sustain analysis of complex problems. It accomplishes this by giving episode-related problems priority access to limited processing resources, by reducing the desire to engage in distracting activities (anhedonia), and by producing psychomotor changes that reduce exposure to distracting stimuli. Because processing resources are limited, the inability to concentrate on other things is a tradeoff that must be made to sustain analysis of the triggering problem. The AR hypothesis is supported by evidence from many levels, including genes, neurotransmitters and their receptors, neurophysiology, neuroanatomy, neuroenergetics, pharmacology, cognition and behavior, and the efficacy of treatments. In addition, we address and provide explanations for puzzling findings in the cognitive and behavioral genetics literatures on depression. In the process, we challenge the belief that serotonin transmission is low in depression. Finally, we discuss implications of the hypothesis for understanding and treating depression.},

Diagnoses were made using data obtained from structured psychiatric interviews (i.e., Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children Epidemiologic Version). Results: Differences emerged between control participants and participants with ADHD on multiple neuropsychological tests. Across all tests, control participants outperformed participants with ADHD. Differences between the two ADHD groups emerged on seven psychological subtests including multiple Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale?Third edition and Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test measures. These test differences did not account for self-reported quality of life differences between groups. Conclusion: The comorbidity with PTSD in adults with ADHD is associated with weaker cognitive performance on several tasks that appear related to spatial/perceptual abilities and fluency. Neuropsychological test performances may share variance with the quality of life variables yet are not mediators of the quality of life ratings.},

  abstract = {Background Many biologically active factors are present in human milk including proteins, lipids, immune factors, and hormones. The milk composition varies over time and shows large inter-individual variability. This study examined variations of human milk immune factors and cortisol concentrations in the first three months post-partum, and their potential associations with maternal psychosocial distress. Methods Seventy-seven healthy mothers with full term pregnancies were enrolled, of which 51 mothers collected morning milk samples at 2, 6 and 12 weeks post-delivery. Maternal psychosocial distress was assessed at 6 weeks post-delivery using questionnaires for stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Immune factors were determined using multiplex immunoassays and included innate immunity factors (IL1{$\beta$}, IL6, IL12, IFN{$\gamma$}, TNF{$\alpha$}), acquired immunity factors (IL2, IL4, IL10, IL13, IL17), chemokines (IL8, Gro{$\alpha$}, MCP1, MIP1{$\beta$}), growth factors (IL5, IL7, GCSF, GMCSF, TGF{$\beta$}2) and immunoglobulins (IgA, total IgG, IgM). Cortisol was quantified using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. A linear mixed effects model was fit to test whether stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms individually predicted human milk cortisol concentrations after accounting for covariates. Repeated measurement analyses were used to compare women with high (n = 13) versus low psychosocial distress (n = 13) for immune factors and cortisol concentrations. Results Virtually all immune factors and cortisol, with the exception of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF), were detected in the human milk samples. The concentrations of the immune factors decreased during the first 3 months, while cortisol concentrations increased over time. No correlation was observed between any of the immune factors and cortisol. No consistent relationship between postnatal psychosocial distress and concentrations of immune factors was found, whereas higher psychosocial distress was predictive of higher cortisol concentrations in human milk. Conclusion In the current study we found no evidence for an association between natural variations in maternal distress and immune factor concentrations in milk. It is uncertain if this lack of association would also be observed in studies with larger populations, with less uniform demographic characteristics, or with women with higher (clinical) levels of anxiety, stress and/or depressive symptoms. In contrast, maternal psychosocial distress was positively related to higher milk cortisol concentrations at week 2 post-delivery. Further investigation on maternal psychosocial distress in relation to human milk composition is warranted.},

Still today hunting ability continues to be selected for in extant foragers with better hunters experiencing greater reproductive success. Yet little is known about the traits that comprise a successful hunter traits that are presupposed to also be under selection. Two complementary empirical analyses were conducted to examine this question using data collected from Hadza hunter\textendash gatherers in Tanzania. First, data on upper-body strength, running speed, target precision and visual and auditory acuity were collected to examine the traits that predict hunting reputation in men. Second, interview data were collected from Hadza informants regarding the traits they deem important for hunting. Results from the first study implicate upper-body strength as the strongest and most consistent predictor of men's hunting reputation. Hadza conventional wisdom also accord with these findings. Although informants stressed the importance of non-physical traits, such as ``intelligence'' and ``heart'', strong arms were cited as the most important physical trait for hunting. Finally, men with stronger upper-bodies experienced greater reproductive success, a result that is largely mediated by hunting reputation. These findings suggest that selection for hunting ability may have acted on men's upper-bodies. Nevertheless, the importance of effort on strength and hunting success cannot be dismissed. This is also discussed.},

In the current research, we investigated the mating performance (i.e., how well people do in attracting and retaining intimate partners) and singlehood status in 14 different countries, namely Austria, Brazil, China, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Peru, Poland, Russia, Spain, Turkey, the UK, and Ukraine (N?=?7,181). We found that poor mating performance was in high occurrence, with about one in four participants scoring low in this dimension, and more than 57\% facing difficulties in starting and/or keeping a relationship. Men and women did not differ in their mating performance scores, but there was a small yet significant effect of age, with older participants indicating higher mating performance. Moreover, nearly 13\% of the participants indicated that they were involuntarily single, which accounted for about one-third of the singles in the sample. In addition, more than 15\% of the participants indicated that they were voluntarily single, and 10\% were between-relationships single. We also found that poor mating performance was associated with an increased likelihood of voluntary, involuntary, and between-relationships singlehood. All types of singlehood were in higher occurrence in younger participants. Although there was some cross-cultural variation, the results were generally consistent across samples.},

  abstract = {I argue that the magnitude and nature of sex differences in aggression, their development, causation, and variability, can be better explained by sexual selection than by the alternative biosocial version of social role theory. Thus, sex differences in physical aggression increase with the degree of risk, occur early in life, peak in young adulthood, and are likely to be mediated by greater male impulsiveness, and greater female fear of physical danger. Male variability in physical aggression is consistent with an alternative life history perspective, and context-dependent variability with responses to reproductive competition, although some variability follows the internal and external influences of social roles. Other sex differences, in variance in reproductive output, threat displays, size and strength, maturation rates, and mortality and conception rates, all indicate that male aggression is part of a sexually selected adaptive complex. Physical aggression between partners can be explained using different evolutionary principles, arising from the conflicts of interest between males and females entering a reproductive alliance, combined with variability following differences in societal gender roles. In this case, social roles are particularly important since they enable both the relatively equality in physical aggression between partners from Western nations, and the considerable cross-national variability, to be explained.},

Two groups of such agents are genes located on the sex chromosomes, and gonadal hormones. The former have coherent linkage to chromosomes that form differently in the two sexes under the influence of genomic forces that are not related to reproductive function, whereas the latter have a direct or indirect relationship to reproduction. Evidence published in the past 5 years supports the identification of several agents of sexual differentiation encoded by the X chromosome in mice, including Kdm5c, Kdm6a, Ogt and Xist. These X chromosome agents have wide pleiotropic effects, potentially influencing sex differences in many different tissues, a characteristic shared with the gonadal hormones. The identification of X chromosome agents of sexual differentiation will facilitate understanding of complex intersecting gene pathways underlying sex differences in disease.},

  abstract = {This new edition of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5\textregistered ), used by clinicians and researchers to diagnose and classify mental disorders, is the product of more than 10 years of effort by hundreds of international experts in all aspects of mental health. Their dedication and hard work have yielded an authoritative volume that defines and classifies mental disorders in order to improve diagnoses, treatment, and research. The criteria are concise and explicit, intended to facilitate an objective assessment of symptom presentations in a variety of clinical settings -- inpatient, outpatient, partial hospital, consultation-liaison, clinical, private practice, and primary care. New features and enhancements make DSM-5\textregistered{} easier to use across all settings:  The chapter organization reflects a lifespan approach, with disorders typically diagnosed in childhood (such as neurodevelopmental disorders) at the beginning of the manual, and those more typical of older adults (such as neurocognitive disorders) placed at the end. Also included are age-related factors specific to diagnosis. The latest findings in neuroimaging and genetics have been integrated into each disorder along with gender and cultural considerations. The revised organizational structure recognizes symptoms that span multiple diagnostic categories, providing new clinical insight in diagnosis. Specific criteria have been streamlined, consolidated, or clarified to be consistent with clinical practice (including the consolidation of autism disorder, Asperger's syndrome, and pervasive developmental disorder into autism spectrum disorder; the streamlined classification of bipolar and depressive disorders; the restructuring of substance use disorders for consistency and clarity; and the enhanced specificity for major and mild neurocognitive disorders). Dimensional assessments for research and validation of clinical results have been provided. Both ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes are included for each disorder, and the organizational structure is consistent with the new ICD-11 in development. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, is the most comprehensive, current, and critical resource for clinical practice available to today's mental health clinicians and researchers of all orientations. The information contained in the manual is also valuable to other physicians and health professionals, including psychologists, counselors, nurses, and occupational and rehabilitation therapists, as well as social workers and forensic and legal specialists.},

Instead of using proxies, actual differences in reproductive success is a more direct measure of Darwinian fitness. Certain voice acoustics such as fundamental frequency and measures of health such as handgrip strength correlate with proxies of fitness, yet there are few studies showing the relation of these traits to reproduction. Here, we explore whether the fundamental frequency of the voice and handgrip strength account for differences in actual reproduction among a population of natural fertility humans. Our results show that both fundamental frequency and handgrip strength predict several measures of reproductive success among a group of indigenous Namibian females, particularly amongst the elderly, with weight also predicting reproductive outcomes among males. These findings demonstrate that both hormonally regulated and phenotypic quality markers can be used as measures of Darwinian fitness among humans living under conditions that resemble the evolutionary environment of Homo sapiens. We also argue that these findings provide support for the Grandmother Hypothesis.},

One debate explicitly about this surrounds food sharing. Some argue that failing to find reciprocal food sharing means that some process other than reciprocity must be occurring, whereas others argue for models that allow reciprocity to span domains in the form of trade (Kaplan and Hill, 1985.). Multilayer networks, high-dimensional networks that allow us to consider multiple sets of relationships at the same time, are ubiquitous and have consequences, so processes giving rise to them are important social phenomena. The analysis of multi-dimensional social networks has recently garnered the attention of the network science community (Kivel\"a et al., 2014). Recent models of these processes show how ignoring layer interdependencies can lead one to miss why a layer formed the way it did, and/or draw erroneous conclusions (G\'orski et al., 2018). Understanding the structuring processes that underlie multiplex networks will help understand increasingly rich data sets, giving more accurate and complete pictures of social interactions.},

  abstract = {Religion is not an evolutionary adaptation per se, but a recurring cultural by-product of the complex evolutionary landscape that sets cognitive, emotional, and material conditions for ordinary human interactions. Religion exploits only ordinary cognitive processes to passionately display costly devotion to counterintuitive worlds governed by supernatural agents. The conceptual foundations of religion are intuitively given by task-specific panhuman cognitive domains, including folkmechanics, folkbiology, and folkpsychology. Core religious beliefs minimally violate ordinary notions about how the world is, with all of its inescapable problems, thus enabling people to imagine minimally impossible supernatural worlds that solve existential problems, including death and deception. Here the focus is on folkpsychology and agency. A key feature of the supernatural agent concepts common to all religions is the triggering of an ``Innate Releasing Mechanism,'' or ``agency detector,'' whose proper (naturally selected) domain encompasses animate objects relevant to hominid survival \textendash{} such as predators, protectors, and prey \textendash{} but which actually extends to moving dots on computer screens, voices in wind, and faces on clouds. Folkpsychology also crucially involves metarepresentation, which makes deception possible and threatens any social order. However, these same metacognitive capacities provide the hope and promise of open-ended solutions through representations of counterfactual supernatural worlds that cannot be logically or empirically verified or falsified. Because religious beliefs cannot be deductively or inductively validated, validation occurs only by ritually addressing the very emotions motivating religion. Cross-cultural experimental evidence encourages these claims.},

We examined patterns of PTSD and depression symptoms after sexual assault to evaluate the extent to which assault survivors primarily reported symptoms of both disorders or whether there were meaningfully distinct subgroups with discordant PTSD and depression symptoms. Methods Latent profile analysis was used to examine self-reported PTSD and depression symptoms among 119 female sexual assault survivors at 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-months post-assault. Results At all time points, a 4-class solution fit the data best, revealing four subgroups with low, low-moderate, high-moderate, and severe levels of both PTSD and depression symptoms. Within each subgroup, PTSD symptom severity co-occurred with comparable depression symptom severity. At no time point were there reliable subgroups with discordant PTSD and depression symptom severities. Emotional numbing, hyperarousal, and overall PTSD symptom severity reliably distinguished each class from the others. Class membership at 1-month post-assault predicted subsequent class membership and functional impairment. Limitations Additional research is needed to evaluate predictors of class membership, temporal stability of classes, and generalizability to other trauma populations. Conclusions Co-occurring and comparably severe PTSD and depression symptoms are pervasive among female sexual assault survivors. The absence of a distinct subset of individuals with only PTSD or depression symptoms suggests that PTSD and depression may be manifestations of a general posttraumatic stress response rather than distinct disorders after trauma. Integrated treatments targeting both PTSD and depression symptoms may therefore prove more efficient and effective.},

  abstract = {A central question in economics is understanding the difficulties that parties have in reaching mutually beneficial agreements. Informational differences provide an appealing explanation for bargaining inefficiencies. This chapter provides an overview of the theoretical and empirical literature on bargaining with incomplete information.The chapter begins with an analysis of bargaining within a mechanism design framework. A modern development is provided of the classic result that, given two parties with independent private valuations, ex post efficiency is attainable if and only if it is common knowledge that gains from trade exist. The classic problems of efficient trade with one-sided incomplete information but interdependent valuations, and of efficiently dissolving a partnership with two-sided incomplete information, are also reviewed using mechanism design.The chapter then proceeds to study bargaining where the parties sequentially exchange offers. Under one-sided incomplete information, it considers sequential bargaining between a seller with a known valuation and a buyer with a private valuation. When there is a "gap" between the seller's valuation and the support of buyer valuations, the seller-offer game has essentially a unique sequential equilibrium. This equilibrium exhibits the following properties: it is stationary, trade occurs in finite time, and the price is favorable to the informed party (the Coase Conjecture). The alternating-offer game exhibits similar properties, when a refinement of sequential equilibrium is applied. However, in the case of "no gap" between the seller's valuation and the support of buyer valuations, the bargaining does not conclude with probability one after any finite number of periods, and it does not follow that sequential equilibria need be stationary. If stationarity is nevertheless assumed, then the results parallel those for the "gap" case. However, if stationarity is not assumed, then instead a folk theorem obtains, so substantial delay is possible and the uninformed party may receive substantial surplus.The chapter also briefly sketches results for sequential bargaining with two-sided incomplete information. Finally, it reviews the empirical evidence on strategic bargaining with private information by focusing on one of the most prominent examples of bargaining: union contract negotiations.},

  abstract = {In recent years, a great deal has been written on the topic of aggression; another book on the same topic might seem superfluous at this time. However, the present volume is not just-or even primarily-about aggres sion. It is, rather, a book on anger. Anger and aggression are closely related phenomena, and it is not possible to discuss one without the other. Yet, not all anger is aggressive, nor can all aggression be attributed to anger. Therefore, somewhat different considerations apply to each. Even more importantly, the type of theoretical generalizations one can make differs depending upon whether the primary focus is on anger or aggression. The present volume is subtitled "an essay on emotion." This indicates that the generalizations to be drawn have more to do with emotional responses (e.g., grief, love, envy, etc.) than with various forms of aggression (e.g., riots, war, crimes of violence, etc.). Stated somewhat differently, anger is here being used as a paradigm case for the study of emotion, not for the study of aggression.},

Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods Medline, EMBASE and PsycINFO were searched from the first record to November 2016. Recent IPV was defined as occurring up to and including the last 12 months; all health outcomes were eligible for inclusion. Results were combined using random-effects meta-analysis. Results 35 separate cohort studies were retrieved. Eight studies showed evidence of a positive association between recent IPV and subsequent depressive symptoms, with a pooled OR from five estimates of 1.76 (95\% CI 1.26 to 2.44, I2=37.5\%, p=0.172). Five studies demonstrated a positive, statistically significant relationship between depressive symptoms and subsequent IPV; the pooled OR from two studies was 1.72 (95\% CI 1.28 to 2.31, I2=0.0\%, p=0.752). Recent IPV was also associated with increased symptoms of subsequent postpartum depression in five studies (OR=2.19, 95\% CI 1.39 to 3.45, p=0.000), although there was substantial heterogeneity. There was some evidence of a bidirectional relationship between recent IPV and hard drug use and marijuana use, although studies were limited. There was no evidence of an association between recent IPV and alcohol use or sexually transmitted infections (STIs), although there were few studies and inconsistent measurement of alcohol and STIs. Conclusions Exposure to violence has significant impacts. Longitudinal studies are needed to understand the temporal relationship between recent IPV and different health issues, while considering the differential effects of recent versus past exposure to IPV. Improved measurement will enable an understanding of the immediate and longer term health needs of women exposed to IPV. Healthcare providers and IPV organisations should be aware of the bidirectional relationship between recent IPV and depressive symptoms. PROSPERO registration number CRD42016033372.},

  abstract = {The initial application of the hygiene hypothesis for autoimmune diseases proposed in the early 2000s has been confirmed and consolidated by a wealth of published data in both animal models and human autoimmune conditions.The hygiene hypothesis probably explains the uneven geographical distribution of autoimmune diseases in the world. Individuals migrating from countries with low incidence of autoimmune diseases to countries with high incidence develop the disease with the frequency of the host country, provided that migration occurred at a young age and under a threshold that varies according to the disease.Pathogenic bacteria, viruses and parasites are often endowed with strong protective effects on autoimmunity even when infection occurs late after birth.Gut commensal bacteria may also have a protective role in autoimmunity when administered early in life.Pathogens, parasites and commensals essentially act by stimulating immune regulatory pathways, implicating the innate and the adaptive immune system. Importantly, the effect is seen with both living organisms and their derivatives or purified extracts.Both pathogens and commensals stimulate pattern recognition receptors, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs) to protect against autoimmunity. This effect may be mimicked by TLR agonists acting through pharmacological stimulation or desensitization of the target receptor.},

It was found to be negatively correlated with handgrip strength (HGS) in men, but the evidence for women is mixed. Such studies in women call for increased detection sensitivity. The present study was designed to reduce potential confounding factors, especially age and ethnicity variation. We measured the digit ratios and HGS of 125 healthy women between 19 and 31 years of age from a remote region in Austria. 2D : 4D of both hands was significantly and negatively correlated with HGS (n = 125, right hand: r = -0.255, p = 0.002, left hand: r = -0.206, p = 0.011). Size, direction and significance of correlation coefficients remained stable when statistically controlling for age, body weight, body height, body mass index or hours of exercise per week. This yields theory-consistent evidence that HGS and 2D : 4D are clearly associated in women-when sufficiently reducing genetic variation (confounding 2D : 4D), the ontogenetic environment and age ranges (confounding HGS) in the study population. This finding implies similar organizing effects of prenatal androgens as in men, pointing to a more parsimonious developmental mechanism and a new look into its proximate and ultimate causes.},

The participants' ratings were correlated with their intellectual, cognitive and psychiatric data. Patients felt they had a lower capacity and marginally lower mastery over their memory than comparison subjects. They reported less recourse to strategies, and higher levels of memory-related anxiety. However, their knowledge of basic memory processes, motivation to succeed, and perception of ageing effects were similar.

Nevertheless, our species-typical capacity for depressed mood implies that it serves an adaptive function. Here we apply an interdisciplinary theory of brain function to explain depressed mood and its clinical manifestations. Combining insights from the free-energy principle (FEP) with evolutionary theorising in psychology, we argue that depression reflects an adaptive response to perceived threats of aversive social outcomes (e.g., exclusion) that minimises the likelihood of surprising interpersonal exchanges (i.e., those with unpredictable outcomes). We suggest that psychopathology typically arises from ineffectual attempts to alleviate interpersonal difficulties and/or hyper-reactive neurobiological responses to social stress (i.e., uncertainty), which often stems from early experience that social uncertainty is difficult to resolve.},

The primary aim of this study was to confirm and quantify the ethnic differences, confirm the sex difference in Caucasians and determine whether there was a similar sex difference in non-Caucasians. A secondary aim was to establish reference ranges for white cell and platelet counts for the different ethnic and sex groups. METHODS: The study population comprised 417 healthy volunteers (201 women and 216 men), of whom 200 were Caucasian, 102 were Afrocaribbean and 115 were African. Full blood counts, including a differential white cell count, were measured using a H.2 automated differential counter. White cell and platelet counts were compared between the three different ethnic groups and between men and women. Reference ranges were determined for each ethnic and sex group. RESULTS: Africans and Afrocaribbeans had lower total white cell, neutrophil and platelet counts than Caucasians and counts were lower in Africans than in Afrocaribbeans. Women had higher neutrophil and platelet counts than men in all ethnic groups. CONCLUSIONS: Sex and ethnic origin should be taken into consideration when assessing white cell and platelet counts.},

However, researcher biases can lead to questionable research practices in secondary data analysis, which can distort the evidence base. While pre-registration can help to protect against researcher biases, it presents challenges for secondary data analysis. In this article, we describe these challenges and propose novel solutions and alternative approaches. Proposed solutions include approaches to (1) address bias linked to prior knowledge of the data, (2) enable pre-registration of non-hypothesis-driven research, (3) help ensure that pre-registered analyses will be appropriate for the data, and (4) address difficulties arising from reduced analytic flexibility in pre-registration. For each solution, we provide guidance on implementation for researchers and data guardians. The adoption of these practices can help to protect against researcher bias in secondary data analysis, to improve the robustness of research based on existing data.},

We therefore conducted two experiments in which we measured the influence of tears on the identification of sadness and the perceived need for social support at an early perceptional level. In two experiments (1 and 2), participants were exposed to sad and neutral faces. In both experiments, the face stimuli were presented for 50 milliseconds. In experiment 1, tears were digitally added to sad faces in one condition. Participants demonstrated a significant faster recognition of sad faces with tears compared to those without tears. In experiment 2, tears were added to neutral faces as well. Participants had to indicate to what extent the displayed individuals were in need of social support. Study participants reported a greater perceived need for social support to both sad and neutral faces with tears than to those without tears.

Yet the circuits and mechanisms that contribute to these differences are understudied, because preclinical studies have historically excluded female rodents. This oversight is beginning to be addressed, and recent studies that include male and female rodents are identifying sex differences in neurobiological processes that underlie features of these disorders, including conflict anxiety, fear processing, arousal, social avoidance, learned helplessness and anhedonia. These findings allow us to conceptualize various types of sex differences in the brain, which in turn have broader implications for considering sex as a biological variable. Importantly, comparing the sexes could aid in the discovery of novel therapeutics.},

  abstract = {,  Global health interventions increasingly target the abolishment of `child marriage' (marriage under 18 years, hereafter referred to as `early marriage'). Guided by human behavioural ecology theory, and drawing on focus groups and in-depth interviews in an urbanising Tanzanian community where female early marriage is normative, we examine the common assumption that it is driven by the interests and coercive actions of parents and/or men. We find limited support for parent\textendash offspring conflict. Parents often encouraged early marriages, but were motivated by the promise of social and economic security for daughters, rather than bridewealth transfers alone. Moreover, forced marriage appears rare, and adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) were active agents in the transition to marriage, sometimes marrying against parental wishes. Support for gendered conflict was stronger. AGYW were described as being lured into unstable relationships by men misrepresenting their long-term intentions. Community members voiced concerns over these marriages. Overall, early marriage appears rooted in limited options, encouraging strategic, but risky choices on the marriage market. Our results highlight plurality and context dependency in drivers of early marriage, even within a single community. We conclude that engaging with the importance of context is fundamental in forging culturally sensitive policies and programs on early marriage.},

  abstract = {Objective: To identify perceptions of risks and benefits of cannabis use during pregnancy and postpartum from the patient perspective. Methods: Pregnant and postpartum (up to 3 months) women residing in a state that legalized the sale of recreational cannabis in 2012 were interviewed to determine their perceptions of risks and benefits of cannabis use during pregnancy and postpartum. Qualitative description methodology was used to identify common themes in the data. Nineteen (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}14 pregnant; n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}5 post-partum) women who used cannabis daily while pregnant were interviewed about perceptions of risks and benefits of cannabis use during pregnancy and postpartum. Results: Five themes, describing the participants' cannabis use while pregnant and postpartum, emerged from the data. These themes include (1) continued use for health management, (2) ongoing evaluative process, (3) mixed messages, (4) wanting more information, and (5) legal considerations. All 5 of these themes contributed to the overarching theme of Taking Care of Mom and Baby, which encompasses the mother's need and struggle to care for her own health and wellness, as well as that of her unborn baby. Conclusions: In a state with legalized recreational cannabis, pregnant and postpartum women reported continuing daily cannabis use during pregnancy to take care of themselves and their baby. It is crucial for healthcare providers to follow national guidelines and explain risks of cannabis use during pregnancy and postpartum, while also managing expectations based on patient history. A harm reduction approach to decrease cannabis use is vital to help pregnant women who are using cannabis for health management to continuously evaluate their use during pregnancy and postpartum.},

Each individual's market value is determined by the benefits it can confer (and is willing to confer) upon others, which selects for tendencies to actively confer benefits on others. In this article, I introduce the basics of biological markets and how they relate to traditional models of cooperation, and then elucidate their impact on human cooperation, especially in the tasks of choosing partners, competing over partners, and keeping partners. Since ``generosity'' is necessarily rated relative to one's rivals, this can result in tendencies to compete over relative generosity, commit to partners, help when help is unnecessary, give strategically, and attack or suppress others' helpfulness. Biological markets explain and make novel predictions about why we desire to associate with particular individuals and how we attract them, and are therefore a useful incorporation into models of cooperation.},

We propose that protecting the environment is similar to other types of cooperation, in that environmentalism functions as a signal of one's willingness to cooperate with others. We test several novel predictions from this hypothesis. We used a mathematical model to show that environmentalism can indicate one's valuation of others and thus one's cooperative intent. We found support for this prediction in two online studies, and then conducted two laboratory studies to extend the idea that environmentalism signals one's willingness to cooperate. Participants donated more to an environmental charity when donations were public than when anonymous, but they donated the most when competing to be chosen by an observer for a subsequent cooperative game. In other words, people competed to donate more to the environment. Bigger donors benefited, as they were subsequently chosen more often and received more cooperation from their partners. Partners benefited from choosing environmental donors: bigger donors cooperated more with subsequent partners, such that environmental donations were reliably informative about participants' future cooperativeness. We compare multiple theories about why people behave environmentally (indirect reciprocity, signal of wealth, signal of cooperative intent), and find most support for our proposed theory of signaling cooperative intent. By understanding the function of environmental behaviour and stimulating competitive giving, we can increase people's support for environmental and other charitable causes.},

Here we investigate how hand form and function interact in modern humans to gain an insight into our evolutionary past. We measured grip strength in a heterogeneous, cross-sectional sample of human participants (n = 662, 17 to 83 years old) to test the potential effects of age, sex, asymmetry (hand dominance and handedness), hand shape, occupation, and practice of sports and musical instruments that involve the hand(s). We found a significant effect of sex and hand dominance on grip strength, but not of handedness, while hand shape and age had a greater influence on female grip strength. Females were significantly weaker with age, but grip strength in females with large hands was less affected than those with long hands. Frequent engagement in hand sports significantly increased grip strength in the non-dominant hand in both sexes, while only males showed a significant effect of occupation, indicating different patterns of hand dominance asymmetries and hand function. These results improve our understanding of the link between form and function in both hands and offer an insight into the evolution of human laterality and dexterity.},

Studies in humans and other mammals have implicated the microbiome in a range of physiologic processes that are vital to host health including energy homeostasis, metabolism, gut epithelial health, immunologic activity, and neurobehavioral development. The microbial genome confers metabolic capabilities exceeding those of the host organism alone, making the gut microbiome an active participant in host physiology. Recent advances in DNA sequencing technology and computational biology have revolutionized the field of microbiomics, permitting mechanistic evaluation of the relationships between an animal and its microbial symbionts. Changes in the gastrointestinal microbiome are associated with diseases in humans and animals including inflammatory bowel disease, asthma, obesity, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, immune-mediated conditions, and neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism spectrum disorder. While there remains a paucity of data regarding the intestinal microbiome in small animals, recent studies have helped to characterize its role in host animal health and associated disease states. This review is intended to familiarize small animal veterinarians with recent advances in the field of microbiomics and to prime them for a future in which diagnostic tests and therapies will incorporate these developments into clinical practice.},

Converging findings from a variety of disciplines are leading to the emergence of a fundamentally new view of the human mind, and with it a new framework for the behavioral and social sciences. First, with the advent of the cognitive revolution, human nature can finally be defined precisely as the set of universal, species-typical information-processing programs that operate beneath the surface of expressed cultural variability. Second, this collection of cognitive programs evolved in the Pleistocene to solve the adaptive problems regularly faced by our hunter-gatherer ancestors - problems such as mate selection, language acquisition, co-operation, and sexual infidelity. Consequently, the traditional view of the mind as a general-purpose computer, tabula rasa, or passive recipient of culture is being replaced by the view that the mind resembles an intricate network of functionally specialized computers, each of which imposes contentful structure on human mental organization and culture. The Adapted Mind explores this new approach - evolutionary psychology - and its implications for a new view of culture.},

In both humans and chimpanzees, they may serve to permit learning from the high ranked and the successful. However, reliance on socially transmitted (cultural) information would be maladaptive without evolved mechanisms to screen out harmful information and retain the useful. One of these filters is preferential attention to the prestigious because prestige can be earned by skill and success. Prestige and dominance, like their underlying sentiments of respect and fear, are intertwined components of often complex and mutable social relationships; these components can be separated experimentally and mathematically but co-occur and evolved together. The evolution of our symbolic (culturally determined) prestige systems most likely involved sexual selection breaking down our ancestral social hierarchies into what we have today: multiple sets of symbolic criteria for the assessment of relative standing, with most sets being marked by competition in terms of a standard of excellence. Symbolic prestige allocation systems would have favored the evolution of cooperation over overt rivalry because they permit cryptic disagreement about relative standing, muting overt conflict and thus, perhaps, permitting the rise of complex, socially stratified societies. Culture does not so much get ``transmitted'' as edited, revised, inferred, and filtered. It is unclear to what extent we were selected to have knowledge-domain-specific mechanisms for cultural learning; an alternative hypothesis is that we rely on preferential attention and learning from the high-in-status across diverse knowledge domains, but that evolution has produced ``switches'' that influence, on the basis of our age, sex, and current status position, which individuals we find prestigious. The corollary of paying preferential attention to the high-in-status is ignoring the low: It often takes an ideology or moral imperative to get the higher ranked to pay attention to them. Apparent lack of compassion for the poor or disabled may often simply be inattention. Mass media challenge the filtering role of preferential attention to the high-in-status because they devalue the coin of local prestige. Today, we risk learning irrelevancies from apparently prestigious strangers at the expense of relevant knowledge learned from locally successful individuals.},

However, such caregiving is vulnerable to exploitation via illness deception, whereby people feign or exaggerate illness in order to gain access to care. Our model demonstrates that aversive treatments can counter-intuitively increase the range of conditions where caregiving is evolutionarily viable, because only individuals who stand to gain substantially from care will accept the treatment. Thus, contemporary and historical ``ineffective'' treatments may be solutions to the problem of allocating care to people whose true need is difficult to discern.},

  abstract = {It is commonly assumed that a person's emotional state can be readily inferred from his or her facial movements, typically called emotional expressions or facial expressions. This assumption influences legal judgments, policy decisions, national security protocols, and educational practices; guides the diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric illness, as well as the development of commercial applications; and pervades everyday social interactions as well as research in other scientific fields such as artificial intelligence, neuroscience, and computer vision. In this article, we survey examples of this widespread assumption, which we refer to as the common view, and we then examine the scientific evidence that tests this view, focusing on the six most popular emotion categories used by consumers of emotion research: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise. The available scientific evidence suggests that people do sometimes smile when happy, frown when sad, scowl when angry, and so on, as proposed by the common view, more than what would be expected by chance. Yet how people communicate anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise varies substantially across cultures, situations, and even across people within a single situation. Furthermore, similar configurations of facial movements variably express instances of more than one emotion category. In fact, a given configuration of facial movements, such as a scowl, often communicates something other than an emotional state. Scientists agree that facial movements convey a range of information and are important for social communication, emotional or otherwise. But our review suggests an urgent need for research that examines how people actually move their faces to express emotions and other social information in the variety of contexts that make up everyday life, as well as careful study of the mechanisms by which people perceive instances of emotion in one another. We make specific research recommendations that will yield a more valid picture of how people move their faces to express emotions and how they infer emotional meaning from facial movements in situations of everyday life. This research is crucial to provide consumers of emotion research with the translational information they require.},

Both are linked to the perpetuation of the species and therefore have a closely linked biological function of crucial evolutionary importance. Yet almost nothing is known about their neural correlates in the human. We therefore used fMRI to measure brain activity in mothers while they viewed pictures of their own and of acquainted children, and of their best friend and of acquainted adults as additional controls. The activity specific to maternal attachment was compared to that associated to romantic love described in our earlier study and to the distribution of attachment-mediating neurohormones established by other studies. Both types of attachment activated regions specific to each, as well as overlapping regions in the brain's reward system that coincide with areas rich in oxytocin and vasopressin receptors. Both deactivated a common set of regions associated with negative emotions, social judgment and `mentalizing', that is, the assessment of other people's intentions and emotions. We conclude that human attachment employs a push\textendash pull mechanism that overcomes social distance by deactivating networks used for critical social assessment and negative emotions, while it bonds individuals through the involvement of the reward circuitry, explaining the power of love to motivate and exhilarate.},

  abstract = {The postpartum period represents a time of increased risk for psychiatric disorders. Mood disorders include postpartum blues, transient depressive symptoms occurring between postpartum days 3\textendash 12 in 50\%\textendash 80\% of new mothers. There is consensus that the incidence of new onset of depression using standard clinical interviews is between 10\%\textendash 15\% in North American and European women who give birth. Therefore postpartum depression is a frequent and significant risk for the new mother. Detection of postpartum depression by primary care providers requires recognition of symptoms of depression or the screening of women with standardized instruments. These tasks are complicated when assessing women from different cultures. This article gives practical recommendations for the many obstetricians who treat women from different cultures. Somatization is a prominent expression of depression in Hispanic, Asian, and African cultures. Complaints of sadness and feelings of guilt are more characteristic of depression in Western cultures than in Hispanic, Asian, or African cultures. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), a widely used self-report screening instrument, does not detect depression in Japanese women and caution needs to be exercised in using it to screen women from non-Western cultures. Low rates of postpartum depression are reported in some studies of Asian women in their native country in contrast to high rates of depression in some immigrant populations. The stress of acculturation could contribute to these differences. Postpartum rituals practiced in several different cultures (Hispanic, Asian, African) can assist the woman in the transition to motherhood. When practiced by immigrant women these rituals could alleviate the acculturation stress. As the United States and Europe become increasingly multicultural, clinicians will want to be aware of the role of culture in the rite of passage to parenthood and in postpartum practices, so that they can better mobilize the woman's internal and external resources.},

We highlight three different domains in which pain may be considered to have positive consequences. First, pain facilitates pleasure by providing an important contrast for pleasurable experiences, increasing sensitivity to sensory input, and facilitating self-rewarding behavior. Second, pain augments self-regulation and enhancement by increasing cognitive control, reducing rumination, and demonstrating virtue. Third, pain promotes affiliation by arousing empathy from others, motivating social connection, and enhancing group formation. Drawing on evidence scattered across a range of academic fields, we provide for reflection on how pain is represented, generate insights into pain-seeking behavior, and draw attention to the role of painful experiences in maximizing positive outcomes.},

Despite recommendations to abstain from cannabis use, its use is increasing during the perinatal period. In this integrative review, we aim to understand women's perspectives about the health aspects of perinatal cannabis use. The following databases were searched: MEDLINE, PsycInfo, EMBASE, and CINAHL. We included quantitative and qualitative studies with a primary focus on perinatal cannabis use. The methodological quality of the included studies was appraised using appropriate checklists. Extracted data were integrated into a single data matrix and iteratively compared across studies to summarize and synthesize the data. Full text of 33 citations was retrieved and reviewed of which 6 studies met the inclusion criteria. Women who continued to use cannabis during pregnancy often perceived no general or pregnancy-specific risk compared to nonusers. The uncertainty regarding adverse perinatal consequences, its perceived therapeutic effects, and lower costs of cannabis compared to that of cigarettes contributed to cannabis use. A lack of communication with health care providers regarding the health aspects of cannabis was evident. Women perceived this lack of counseling as an indication that adverse outcomes associated with cannabis use are not significant. Women's perceptions of health risks associated with cannabis use are important factors in the decision-making process regarding use or cessation, particularly as legal concerns are fading away. A discussion about health concerns surrounding cannabis use may influence women's perceptions of risk and help them to make informed choices.},

Method~         A meta-analysis of 84 studies published in the decade of the 1990s was conducted to determine the magnitude of the relationships between postpartum depression and various risk factors. Using the software system Advanced Basic Meta-Analysis, effect sizes were calculated three ways: unweighted, weighted by sample size, and weighted by quality index score.         Results~         Thirteen significant predictors of postpartum depression were revealed. Ten of the 13 risk factors had moderate effect sizes while three predictors had small effect sizes. The mean effect size indicator ranges for each risk factor were as follows: prenatal depression (.44 to .46), self esteem (.45 to. 47), childcare stress (.45 to .46), prenatal anxiety (.41 to .45), life stress (.38 to .40), social support (.36 to .41), marital relationship (.38 to .39), history of previous depression (.38 to .39), infant temperament (.33 to .34), maternity blues (.25 to .31), marital status (.21 to .35), socioeconomic status (.19 to .22), and unplanned/unwanted pregnancy (.14 to .17).

Some human milk (HM) bioactive factors, such as HM prebiotic carbohydrates that select for beneficial bacteria, and the specific human milk microbiota (HMM) are emerging as early mediators in the relationship between the development of GM in early life and clinical outcomes. The beneficial role of HM becomes even more crucial for preterm infants, who are exposed to significant risks of severe infection in early life as well as to adverse short and long-term outcomes. When MOM is unavailable or insufficient, donor human milk (DHM) constitutes the optimal nutritional choice. However, little is known about the specific effect of DHM on preterm GM and its potential functional implication on HMM.

By the end of the first year individual differences in crying reflect the history of maternal responsiveness rather than constitutional differences in infant irritability. Close physical contact is the most frequent maternal intervention and the most effective in terminating crying. Nevertheless, maternal effectiveness in terminating crying was found to be less powerful than promptness of response in reducing crying in subsequent months. Evidence suggests that whereas crying is expressive at first, it can later be a mode of communication directed specifically toward the mother. The development of noncrying modes of communication, as well as a decline in crying, is associated with maternal responsiveness to infant signals. The findings are discussed in an evolutionary context, and with reference to the popular belief that to respond to his cries "spoils" a baby.}

Evidence consistent with the proposition that individuals differ in plasticity is reviewed. The authors document multiple instances in which (a) phenotypic temperamental characteristics, (b) endophenotypic attributes, and (c) specific genes function less like ``vulnerability factors'' and more like ``plasticity factors,'' thereby rendering some individuals more malleable or susceptible than others to both negative and positive environmental influences.

To evaluate the unique contributions of these factors, the authors of present article examined data from a national sample 1364 mothers and their children participating in the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development. Harshness was operationalized as income-to-needs ratio in the first 5 years of life; unpredictability was indexed by residential changes, paternal transitions, and parental job changes during this same period. Here the proposition was tested that these factors not only uniquely predict accelerated life-history strategy, operationalized in terms of sexual behavior at age 15, but that such effects are mediated by change over the early-childhood years in maternal depression and, thereby, observed maternal sensitivity in the early-elementary-school years. Structural equation modeling provided empirical support for Ellis et al.'s (2009) theorizing, calling attention once again to the contribution of evolutionary analysis to understanding contemporary human parenting and development. Implications of the findings for intervention are discussed.},

Healthy adults (N = 100, age 21 to 79) studied word pairs, completed item and association recognition tests, and rated the effectiveness of shallow (e.g., repetition) and deep (e.g., imagery or sentence generation) encoding strategies. Advanced age was associated with reduced working memory (WM) capacity and poorer associative recognition. In addition, reduced WM capacity, beliefs in the utility of ineffective encoding strategies, and lack of endorsement of effective ones were independently associated with impaired associative memory. Thus, maladaptive beliefs about memory in conjunction with reduced cognitive resources account in part for differences in associative memory commonly attributed to aging.},

  abstract = {Although intimate partner violence (IPV) is a well-studied topic, surprisingly little consensus among researchers has been reached with regard to the definition and measurement of its major typologies and constructs. The rigorous development and testing of prevention and intervention strategies on a large scale are hampered by many of these methodological difficulties as well as ethical considerations that make conducting IPV research difficult. The author presents a review of the current state of IPV research in these three areas (ethics, methods, and measurement) with suggestions for innovative research possibilities building from this status quo. Moving the field of IPV research forward is necessary to establish a broader evidence base for the prevention and treatment of abuse and to improve outcomes for survivors of IPV.},

  abstract = {The claim that we have a moral obligation, where a choice can be made, to bring to birth the 'best' child possible, has been highly controversial for a number of decades. More recently Savulescu has labelled this claim the Principle of Procreative Beneficence. It has been argued that this Principle is problematic in both its reasoning and its implications, most notably in that it places lower moral value on the disabled. Relentless criticism of this proposed moral obligation, however, has been unable, thus far, to discredit this Principle convincingly and as a result its influence shows no sign of abating. I will argue that while criticisms of the implications and detail of the reasoning behind it are well founded, they are unlikely to produce an argument that will ultimately discredit the obligation that the Principle of Procreative Beneficence represents. I believe that what is needed finally and convincingly to reveal the fallacy of this Principle is a critique of its ultimate theoretical foundation, the notion of impersonal harm. In this paper I argue that while the notion of impersonal harm is intuitively very appealing, its plausibility is based entirely on this intuitive appeal and not on sound moral reasoning. I show that there is another plausible explanation for our intuitive response and I believe that this, in conjunction with the other theoretical criticisms that I and others have levelled at this Principle, shows that the Principle of Procreative Beneficence should be rejected.},

  abstract = {Experimental endotoxemia is a translational model to study inflammatory mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of mood disorders including depression. Disturbed affective cognition constitutes a core aspect in depression, but has never been studied in the context of inflammation. We combined experimental endotoxemia with an established experimental mood induction procedure to assess the interaction between acute inflammation and sad mood and their effects on affective cognition. In this randomized cross-over study, N\,=\,15 healthy males received endotoxin (0.8\,ng/kg lipopolysaccharide iv) on one~study day and placebo an otherwise identical study day. The affective Go/Nogo task was conducted after experimental induction of neutral and sad mood. Inflammatory markers were assessed hourly. Endotoxin application induced a transient systemic inflammation, characterized by increased leukocyte counts, TNF-alpha and interleukin-6 plasma concentrations (all p\,{$<$}\,0.01, interaction effects). Mood induction led to greater sadness ratings, with highest ratings when sad mood was induced during inflammation (p\,{$<$}\,0.05, interaction effect). Based on a 2 (endotoxin vs. placebo)\,\texttimes\,2 (sad vs. neutral mood)\,\texttimes\,2 (sad vs. happy Go/Nogo target words) factorial design, we observed a significant target\,\texttimes\,endotoxin condition interaction (p\,{$<$}\,0.01) reflecting slower responses to sad targets during endotoxemia. Additionally, we found a valence\,\texttimes\,mood interaction (p\,{$<$}\,0.05), reflecting slower reaction times to sad targets in sad mood. In summary, acute inflammation and sad mood are risk factors for disturbed affective cognition. The results may reflect a mood-congruency effect, with prolonged and sustained processing of mood-congruent information during acute inflammation, which may contribute to depression risk.},

  abstract = {Evolutionary approaches to medicine are varied and underpinned by an understanding of basic principles in evolutionary biology. Rather than considering immediate or proximate causes for pathologies, or norms among and between individuals which is more typical of clinicians, evolutionary concepts address ultimate or ``why'' questions, as well as individual variation. Early evolutionary approaches in the nineteenth century underwent a demise with the rise of eugenics, and it was not until the 1990s that these approaches have re-emerged. While the literature in evolutionary medicine in recent decades has been typified by somewhat separate groups representing themes drawn from genetics, social science, and early life development, there has been a recent coalescence of the field as new endeavours have emerged, including an international society, two journals, and a multitude of academic papers. Evolutionary medicine now has increased visibility with a key aim of influencing medical thought and practice to revolutionise approaches to health and illness. Medical schools are already incorporating its principles into everyday practice and teaching, often with students at the vanguard of change. Evolutionary principles are perhaps poised to become embedded into everyday medical thinking.},

  abstract = {Background: Breastfeeding is associated with substantial benefits for both the child and mother. Most guidelines state that women who use illicit drugs should not breastfeed. Although this recommendation has traditionally included marijuana, this drug's changing legal status and the limited scientific research regarding marijuana's effect on breastfeeding and the nursing child may lead to varying recommendations made by lactation professionals to clients who use marijuana. Additionally, to our knowledge, there are no data estimating the prevalence of marijuana use among breastfeeding women, making it unclear how common it is. This study assessed recommendations around breastfeeding and marijuana use and estimated the prevalence of marijuana use among breastfeeding women. Materials and Methods: A convenience sample of lactation professionals who practice throughout New England and were attending the 2014 Vermont Lactation Consultant Association conference was offered the opportunity to complete a five-item survey. Results: Of 120 conference attendees, 74 completed the survey. Forty-four percent reported their recommendations around breastfeeding and marijuana use depended on factors like the severity of maternal use. Another 41\% reported recommending continued breastfeeding because the benefits outweigh the harms. The remaining 15\% reported recommending that a woman should stop breastfeeding if she cannot stop using marijuana. Survey completers estimated that 15\% (1,203/7,843) of their breastfeeding clients in the past year used marijuana. Conclusions: Lactation professionals vary widely in their recommendations to breastfeeding clients who use marijuana. The estimate of prevalence also suggests this is a relatively common issue. More research is needed to assess the generalizability of these findings.},

We then examine important but understudied questions about Screeners. We show that using a single Screener is not the most effective way to improve data quality. Instead, we recommend using multiple items to measure attention. We also show that Screener passage correlates with politically relevant characteristics, which limits the generalizability of studies that exclude failers. We conclude that attention is best measured using multiple Screener questions and that studies using Screeners can balance the goals of internal and external validity by presenting results conditional on different levels of attention.},

The 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report (QIDS-SR16) provides a means to assess core depressive symptoms. Item response theory and classical test theory analyses were conducted to examine differences between postpartum (n=95) and nonpostpartum (n=50) women using the QIDS-SR16. The two groups of females were matched on the basis of age. All met DSM-IV criteria for nonpsychotic major depressive disorder. Low energy level and restlessness/agitation were major characteristics of depression in both groups. The nonpostpartum group reported more sad mood, more suicidal ideation, and more reduced interest. In contrast, for postpartum depression sad mood was less prominent, while psychomotor symptoms (restlessness/agitation) and impaired concentration/decision-making were most prominent. These symptomatic differences between postpartum and other depressives suggest the need to include agitation/restlessness and impaired concentration/decision-making among screening questions for postpartum depression.

With legalization of marijuana in several US states and a 1990 study in which authors documented psychomotor deficits in infants breastfed by mothers using marijuana, there is a need for information on potential exposure to the breastfed infant. Our objective with this study was to quantify cannabinoids in human milk after maternal marijuana use.Between 2014 and 2017, 50 breastfeeding women who reported marijuana use provided 54 breast milk samples to a research repository, Mommy's Milk. Concentrations of {$\Delta$}-9-tetrahydrocannabinol ({$\increment$}9-THC), 11-hydroxy-{$\Delta$}-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol, and cannabinol were measured by using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry electrospray ionization.{$\increment$}9-THC was detectable in 34 (63\%) of the 54 samples up to {$\sim$}6 days after last reported use; the median concentration of {$\increment$}9-THC was 9.47 ng/mL (range: 1.01\textendash 323.00). Five samples had detectable levels of 11-hydroxy-{$\Delta$}-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (range: 1.33\textendash 12.80 ng/mL) or cannabidiol (range: 1.32\textendash 8.56 ng/mL). The sample with the highest concentration of cannabidiol (8.56 ng/mL) did not have measurable {$\increment$}9-THC. Cannabinol was not detected in any samples. The number of hours since last use was a significant predictor of log {$\increment$}9-THC concentrations (-0.03; 95\% confidence interval [CI] -0.04 to -0.01; P = .005). Adjusted for time since last use, the number of daily uses and time from sample collection to analysis were also significant predictors of log {$\increment$}9-THC concentrations (0.51; 95\% CI 0.03 to 0.99; P = .039; 0.08; 95\% CI 0.00 to 0.15; P = .038, respectively).{$\increment$}9-THC was measurable in a majority of breast milk samples up to {$\sim$}6 days after maternal marijuana use.},

  abstract = {The progressive building of the infants' gut microbiota is pivotal for educating their immune system. Human breast milk is among the first sources of microbes for the assembly of the infant's microbiota, but research struggles to give a demonstration for the origin of bacteria in milk. Aiming at contributing to the knowledge on assembly of the mother's milk and infant's microbiome, here we characterized the oral, gut and milk ecosystems in a homogeneous cohort of 36 healthy mother\textendash infants pairs, by 16S rRNA next-generation sequencing. A limited number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) was shared among the three ecosystems, including not only OTUs assigned to the wellknown immune-modulating Bifidobacterium genus, but also specific Streptococcus and Staphylococcus OTUs, which were dominant in the infant's mouth ecosystem. The high conservation of these OTUs among the three ecosystems seems to call for a worth exploring ecological role through targeted and/or culture-dependent techniques. Notwithstanding the limitations of a 16S rRNA gene-based molecular characterization, we might hypothesize that the baby's mouth, being the transition point for the milk to reach the intestine, could play a role in both the gut microbiota assembly, via deglutition, and mother's milk duct colonization, during suction.},

Examining the nature of the comorbidity between pediatric attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. Objective: This study sought to address the link between attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in youth by providing a comprehensive comparison of clinical correlates of ADHD subjects with and without PTSD across multiple non-overlapping domains of functioning and familial patterns of transmission. Method: Participants were 271 youths with ADHD and 230 controls without ADHD of both sexes along with their siblings. Participants completed a large battery of measures designed to assess psychiatric comorbidity, psychosocial, educational, and cognitive parameters. Results: Post-traumatic stress disorder was significantly higher in ADHD probands vs. controls (5.2\% vs. 1.7\%, {$\chi$}2(1) = 4.36, P = 0.04). Irrespective of the comorbidity with PTSD, ADHD subjects had similar ages at onset of ADHD, similar type and mean number of ADHD symptoms, and similar ADHD-associated impairments. PTSD in ADHD probands was significantly associated with a higher risk of psychiatric hospitalization, school impairment, poorer social functioning and higher prevalences of mood, conduct disorder, and anxiety disorders. The mean onset of PTSD (12.6 years) was significantly later than that of ADHD and comorbid disorders (all P {$<$} 0.05). Siblings of ADHD and ADHD + PTSD probands had higher prevalences of ADHD vs. siblings of controls (35\% vs. 18\%, z = 4.00, P {$<$} 0.001 and 67\% vs. 18\%, z = 4.02, P {$<$} 0.001 respectively) and siblings of ADHD+PTSD probands had a significantly higher prevalence of PTSD compared with the siblings of ADHD and control probands (20\% vs. 3\% and 3\%, z = 2.99, P = 0.003 and z = 2.07, P = 0.04 respectively). Conclusion: Findings indicate that the comorbidity with PTSD in ADHD leads to greater clinical severity as regards psychiatric comorbidity and psychosocial dysfunction. ADHD is equally familial in the presence of PTSD in the proband indicating that their co-occurrence is not owing to diagnostic error.},

  abstract = {Organisms sometimes appear to use extravagant traits, or ``handicaps'', to signal their quality to an interested receiver. Before they were used as signals, many of these traits might have been selected to increase with individual quality for reasons apart from conveying information, allowing receivers to use the traits as ``cues'' of quality. However, current theory does not explain when and why cues of individual quality become exaggerated into costly handicaps. We address this here, using a game-theoretic model of adaptive signalling. Our model predicts that: (1) signals will honestly reflect signaler quality whenever there is a positive relationship between individual quality and the signalling trait's naturally selected, non-informational optimum; and (2) the slope of this relationship will determine the amount of costly signal exaggeration, with more exaggeration favored when the slope is more shallow. A shallow slope means that a lower quality male would pay only a small fitness cost to have the same trait value as a higher quality male, and this drives the exaggeration of signals as high-quality signalers are selected to distinguish themselves. Our model reveals a simple and potentially widespread mechanism for ensuring signal honesty and predicts a natural continuum of signalling strategies, from cost-free cues to costly handicaps.},

I argue that while reproducing certain cultural ideas about women's inherent emotional fragility, women's suicide also challenges the honour system in powerful ways and opens possibilities for voicing discontent. I qualify female suicide as the 'art of the weak' (De Certeau 1980, 6), a covert form of protest, a performance-in the sense of Bauman (2004)-that builds upon traditional popular 'knowledge' about gender in order to manage the impression of an audience and make women's claims audible.},

In addition, the literature is inconclusive as to whether there are significant differences among various cultures in the prevalence of postpartum depression. The purpose of this literature review is to identify and critically review published and unpublished studies regarding the effect of cultural factors on the alleviation or deterioration of postpartum depression.

  abstract = {Objectives. Infection with helminths is associated with shifts in host immunity, including increased production of immunoglobulin E (IgE) and reduced inflammation. Given limited energy budgets, these shifts may involve changes in energy allocation toward competing demands. Here we test for potential trade-offs between growth, IgE, and the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (CRP). Methods. Dried blood spots and anthropometrics were collected from 162 Shuar forager-horticulturalists from a village in southeastern Ecuador. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were used to measure IgE and CRP. Relationships among IgE, CRP, and anthropometrics were examined in three groups: children aged 2\textendash 7 years (n 5 63), children aged 8\textendash 15 (n 5 61), and adults over age 18 (n 5 37). Results. Geometric mean IgE was 1,196 IU ml21 while geometric mean CRP was 1.33 mg l21. In children, IgE and CRP were negatively correlated (r 5 20.21, P 5 0.02, df 5 122). Controlling for fat stores and age, IgE was associated with lower stature in children (t 5 22.04, P 5 0.04, df 5 109), and adults (t 5 23.29, P {$<$} 0.01, df 5 33). In children there was a significant interaction between age and CRP, such that in younger children CRP was associated with shorter stature, but in older children was associated with greater stature (t 5 2.15, P 5 0.04, df 5 109). Conclusions.These results suggest that infection with helminths may have hidden costs associated with immunological changes, and that these costs may ultimately affect growth and other life history parameters.

Yet much knowledge of the immune system is based on industrialised populations where these infections are relatively rare. Aim: This study examines distributions and age-related differences in 22 measures of immune function for Bolivian forager-horticulturalists and US and European populations. Subjects and methods: Subjects were 6338 Tsimane aged 0\textendash 90 years. Blood samples collected between 2004\textendash 2014 were analysed for 5-part blood differentials, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and total immunoglobulins E, G, A and M. Flow cytometry was used to quantify na\texteuro\i ve and non-na\texteuro\i ve CD4 and CD8 T cells, natural killer cells, and B cells. Results: Compared to reference populations, Tsimane have elevated levels of most immunological parameters, particularly immunoglobulins, eosinophils, ESR, B cells, and natural killer cells. However, monocytes and basophils are reduced and na\texteuro\i ve CD4 cells depleted in older age groups. Conclusion: Tsimane ecology leads to lymphocyte repertoires and immunoglobulin profiles that differ from those observed in industrialised populations. These differences have consequences for disease susceptibility and co-vary with patterns of other life history traits, such as growth and reproduction.},

Shamanism also existed among nearly all documented hunter-gatherers, likely characterized the religious lives of many ancestral humans, and is often proposed by anthropologists to be the ``first profession,'' representing the first institutionalized division of labor beyond age and sex. In this article, I propose a cultural evolutionary theory to explain why shamanism consistently develops and, in particular, (1) why shamanic traditions exhibit recurrent features around the world; (2) why shamanism professionalizes early, often in the absence of other specialization; and (3) how shifting social conditions affect the form or existence of shamanism. According to this theory, shamanism is a set of traditions developed through cultural evolution that adapts to people's intuitions to convince observers that a practitioner can influence otherwise unpredictable, significant events. The shaman does this by ostensibly transforming during initiation and trance, violating folk intuitions of humanness to assure group members that he or she can interact with the invisible forces that control uncertain outcomes. Entry requirements for becoming a shaman persist because the practitioner's credibility depends on his or her ``transforming.'' This contrasts with dealing with problems that have identifiable solutions (such as building a canoe), in which credibility hinges on showing results and outsiders can invade the jurisdiction by producing the outcome. Shamanism is an ancient human institution that recurs because of the capacity of cultural evolution to produce practices adapted to innate psychological tendencies.},

To accomplish these goals, we first review current conceptual thinking on status and other related bases of social hierarchy. We then present a review of recent empirical evidence that supports differentiation among these bases of social hierarchy, focusing primarily on empirical work that differentiates status and power. We then propose an integrative framework that organizes the many related, yet distinct constructs that describe social hierarchy.

Physical size is related to status in many species\textemdash including humans\textemdash and may affect both real and perceived status. We refer to this as the status-size hypothesis, the automatic association between physical size and position in a status hierarchy. We review the evidence for this hypothesis, drawing on both human and non-human data. Furthermore, we distinguish between different aspects of physical size and pathways to obtain status in groups with implications for the status-size effect. We find that height and muscularity differently affect status perception, and that status obtained through coercion (dominance) differently affects size perception than status obtained through voluntary deference (prestige). Furthermore, contextual cues of competition versus cooperation moderate the status\textendash size relationship. A review of results from various studies, including our own, supports various predictions from the hypothesis: (a) high status dominant and prestigious individuals are estimated taller, and (b) taller individuals are estimated higher in prestige and dominance-based status; (c) dominant high-status individuals are perceived as more muscular than prestigious high-status individuals, (d) more muscular individuals are perceived as dominant but not necessarily prestigious; finally (e) unlike adults, primary school-aged children associate size with dominance but not with prestige, suggesting that though dominance may be universally linked to increased size, the relationship between height and prestige is culturally learned.},

The ARE was continuously occupied throughout the late glacial primarily by small groups on seasonal logistical forays in a low-mobility land-use system, with evidence for a shift to a high-mobility system in the Younger Dryas and early Holocene at some sites. The earliest settlers of Alaska procured resources in the ARE and continued to do so throughout the late glacial. Long-distance transport of lithic material over hundreds of kilometers suggests that seasonal occupation of the ARE was just one facet of a wide-ranging, seasonally variable land-use strategy. These data provide an important counterpoint to studies suggesting that late-glacial settlement systems were focused in the lowlands, and indicate that the earliest settlers quickly mapped on to widely dispersed resources in lowland and upland settings.},

However, the constellation of techniques required for scale development and evaluation can be onerous, jargon-filled, unfamiliar, and resource-intensive. Further, it is often not a part of graduate training. Therefore, our goal was to concisely review the process of scale development in as straightforward a manner as possible, both to facilitate the development of new, valid, and reliable scales and to help improve existing ones. To do this, we have created a primer for best practices for scale development in measuring complex phenomenon. This is not a systematic review, but rather the amalgamation of technical literature and lessons learned from our experiences spent creating or adapting a number of scales over the past several decades. We identified three phases that span nine steps. In the first phase, items are generated and the validity of their content is assessed. In the second phase, the scale is constructed. Steps in scale construction include pre-testing the questions, administering the survey, reducing the number of items, and understanding how many factors the scale captures. In the third phase, scale evaluation, the number of dimensions is tested, reliability is tested, and validity is assessed. We have also added examples of best practices to each step. In sum, this primer will equip both scientists and practitioners to understand the ontology and methodology of scale development and validation, thereby facilitating the advancement of our understanding of a range of health, social, and behavioral outcomes},

The human life cycle, however, is best described by five stages: infant, child, juvenile, adolescent, and adult. Women in both traditional and industrial societies may also have a long post-reproductive stage. Analyses of bones and teeth of early hominids who died as subadults suggest that the evolution of the new life stages of childhood and adolescence are not of ancient origin. The current human pattern evolved after the appearance of Homo erectus. It is possible that evidence for the existence of the post-reproductive stage for women will also be recoverable from the fossil record because the hormonal changes associated with menopause have profound effects on bone density and histology of tubular bones. It is hypothesized that the new life stages of the human life cycle represent feeding and reproductive specializations of the genus Homo. \textcopyright{} 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {The origins of human childhood have fascinated scholars from many disciplines. Some researchers argue that childhood, and many other human characteristics, evolved by heterochrony, an evolutionary process that alters the timing of growth stages from ancestors to their descendants. Other scholars argue against heterochrony, but so far have not offered a well-developed alternative hypothesis. This essay presents such an alternative. Childhood is defined as a unique developmental stage of humans. Childhood is the period following infancy, when the youngster is weaned from nursing but still depends on older people for feeding and protection. The biological constraints of childhood, which include an immature dentition, a small digestive system, and a calorie-demanding brain that is both relatively large and growing rapidly, necessitate the care and feeding that older individuals must provide. Evidence is presented that childhood evolved as a new stage hominid life history, first appearing, perhaps, during the time of Homo habilis. The value of childhood is often ascribed to learning many aspects of human culture. It is certainly true that childhood provides ``extra'' time for brain development and learning. However, the initial selective value of childhood may be more closely related to parental strategies to increase reproductive success. Childhood allows a woman to give birth to new offspring and provide care for existing dependent young. Understanding the nature of childhood helps to explain why humans have lengthy development and low fertility, but greater reproductive success than any other species.

Here we summarize that literature and present new data regarding links between masculinity and multiple measures of health condition in human males. Undergraduate males were photographed and their faces were assessed for sexual dimorphism using multiple methods and rated for apparent healthiness and attractiveness. Participants also reported recent health experiences both prior to being photographed and then again 10 weeks later. Although both attractiveness and rated health were associated with better actual health in the past and future (mainly indexed by lower antibiotic use), results were mixed for masculinity. With respect to respiratory illnesses, facial masculinity (assessed using morphometric techniques) was associated with better past health but with worse future health. Possible reasons for the complex and inconsistent findings are discussed and some potentially fruitful avenues of future research are outlined.},

This study reappraised how evolutionary theory could explain PPD as an adaptation through investigating the relationship between maternal age and PPD, and if this relationship is modified according to the number of children at home. Methods A cross-sectional study carried out in five primary health care units included 811 participants randomly selected among mothers of children up to five postpartum months in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Postpartum depression was defined by scores above 11 on Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), and statistical analysis was based on multivariate logistic regression models. Results One hundred and ninety-seven (24.3\%, CI 95\% 21.3\textendash 27.2) participants were classified as PPD positives. Maternal age was significantly associated to PPD (OR=0.96, p-value=0.019) independently of socioeconomic and reproductive characteristics, conjugal status or substance consumption by the couple. Thus, for each additional year, a reduction of 4\% in the chance of developing PPD could be anticipated, effect which was not modified by the number of children at home (p-value=0.602). Limitations Information on social support was not included in this analysis since its relationship with maternal mental health would be better evaluated in a prospective fashion. Conclusions These findings suggest that adaptive mechanisms shaped through human generations persist contributing to the development of PPD in contemporary societies. According to this evolutionary approach, as maternal age advances the reproductive potential diminishes and, consequently, mothers are less prone to develop PPD and reduce investment in new offspring.},

However, which aspects of parenting are actually mother-specific and which rely on general cognitive abilities remains debated. For example, refuting earlier findings, a recent study demonstrated that fathers identify their own baby from their cries just as well as mothers. Here we show that this performance is independent not only of sex, but also of parenthood status. We found that mothers' ability to recognize their newborn from their cries increased rapidly within few days postpartum, with highly multiparous mothers performing better. However, both male and female non-parents could similarly recognize an assigned baby, even after a very short exposure. As in mothers, both the initial amount of experimental exposure to the baby's cries (learning opportunity) and prior experience of caring for infants (auditory expertise) affected participants' performance. We thus suggest that, rather than being female-specific or motherhood-dependent, the ability to recognize a baby from their cries derives from general auditory and learning skills. By being available to non-parents of both sexes, it may contribute to the caregiving flexibility required for efficient cooperative breeding in humans.},

One perspective, inspired from behavioral ecology, attempts to measure the fitness effects of religious practices.

Qualitative analysis of faculty reports of kisses of death in Study 1 (N {$\frac{1}{4}$} 155) produced seven categories: lack of collegiality, questionable qualifications, lack of professional polish, poor preparation, lack of fit, poorly constructed materials, and lack of enthusiasm. Study 2 (N {$\frac{1}{4}$} 297) explored the severity of kisses of death. Ratings of the severity of lack of collegiality, professionalism, preparation, and enthusiasm were similar across baccalaureate, master's, and doctoral institutions, but teaching- and research-related kisses of death showed significant differences. The results suggest that, in addition to building basic qualifications, aspiring faculty should be aware of the skills and strategies that will allow them to avoid kisses of death in the hiring process.},

  abstract = {Accelerated evolution of the human brain and muscle metabolomes reflects our unique cognitive and physical capacities., Metabolite concentrations reflect the physiological states of tissues and cells. However, the role of metabolic changes in species evolution is currently unknown. Here, we present a study of metabolome evolution conducted in three brain regions and two non-neural tissues from humans, chimpanzees, macaque monkeys, and mice based on over 10,000 hydrophilic compounds. While chimpanzee, macaque, and mouse metabolomes diverge following the genetic distances among species, we detect remarkable acceleration of metabolome evolution in human prefrontal cortex and skeletal muscle affecting neural and energy metabolism pathways. These metabolic changes could not be attributed to environmental conditions and were confirmed against the expression of their corresponding enzymes. We further conducted muscle strength tests in humans, chimpanzees, and macaques. The results suggest that, while humans are characterized by superior cognition, their muscular performance might be markedly inferior to that of chimpanzees and macaque monkeys., Physiological processes that maintain our tissues' functionality involve the generation of multiple products and intermediates known as metabolites\textemdash small molecules with a weight of less than 1,500 Daltons. Changes in concentrations of these metabolites are thought to be closely related to changes in phenotype. Here, we assessed concentrations of more than 10,000 metabolites in three brain regions and two non-neural tissues (skeletal muscle and kidney) of humans, chimpanzees, macaque monkeys, and mice using mass spectrometry-based approaches. We found that the evolution of the metabolome largely reflects genetic divergence between species and is not greatly affected by environmental factors. In the human lineage, however, we observed an exceptional acceleration of metabolome evolution in the prefrontal cortical region of the brain and in skeletal muscle. Based on additional behavioral tests, we further show that metabolic changes in human muscle seem to be paralleled by a drastic reduction in muscle strength. The observed rapid metabolic changes in brain and muscle, together with the unique human cognitive skills and low muscle performance, might reflect parallel mechanisms in human evolution.},

  abstract = {Objective Low-grade chronic inflammation is increasingly being implicated in cardiovascular disease (CVD) etiology and may represent an alternative pathway through which testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) influence CVD risk. We examined the associations between endogenous testosterone, SHBG and total and differential white blood cell (WBC) counts in men. Methods Cross-sectional study of 2418 men aged 40\textendash 78 years from the Norfolk population of European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC-Norfolk) who had no history of CVD or cancer and complete data on sex hormones (total testosterone (TT), SHBG and free testosterone (FT)) and WBC counts. Associations between sex hormones and WBC counts were assessed using linear regression models. Results Higher SHBG and TT levels were associated with lower WBC counts. After adjustment for age, BMI, smoking, physical activity and diabetes status, total WBC count decreased by 0.163 (95\% CI -0.236; -0.091) and 0.102 (-0.170; -0.034) per standard deviation (SD) increase in SHBG and TT respectively. Associations of SHBG and TT with total WBC count were mainly accounted for by a lower granulocyte count ({$\beta$} coefficient=-0.132 (-0.194; -0.070) per SD increase in SHBG and {$\beta$} coefficient=-0.104 (-0.161; -0.046) per SD increase in TT). No associations between FT and total and differential WBC counts were found. Conclusions Endogenous TT and SHBG levels are inversely associated with total WBC and granulocyte count in middle-aged and older men. Even though the underlying mechanism and causal directionality requires further exploration, these results support a link between hormonal status and low-grade inflammation.},

This study seeks to examine the link between disability and IPV in a nationally representative sample of U.S. women and men. Also, by establishing that disability preceded recent IPV victimization, this study allows for a more thorough understanding of whether people with disabilities are at greater risk of victimization subsequent to having a disability. Methods Data were analyzed from the 2010 National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey, an ongoing, national random digit dial telephone survey of U.S. adults. Estimates of age-adjusted 12-month IPV prevalence by disability status were calculated. Results Compared to women without a disability, women with a disability were significantly more likely to report experiencing each form of IPV measured, which includes rape, sexual violence other than rape, physical violence, stalking, psychological aggression, and control of reproductive or sexual health. For men, significant associations were found with respect to stalking and psychological aggression by an intimate partner. Conclusions The results suggest that people with a disability are at greater risk of victimization and that primary and secondary prevention efforts might be targeted to those with a disability.},

In this brief methods review, we introduce theoretical framings, methodological conventions, and ethical concerns around field-collection of markers of psychosocial stress that have emerged from 50 years of research at the intersection of anthropology and human biology. Highlighting measures of psychosocial stress outcomes most often used in biocultural studies, we identify the circumstances under which varied measures are most appropriately applied and provide examples of the types of cutting-edge research questions these measures can address. We explain that field-based psychosocial stress measures embedded in different body systems are neither equivalent nor interchangeable, but this recognition strengthens the study of stress as always simultaneously cultural and biological, situated in local ecologies, social\textendash political structures, and time.},

  abstract = {The evolution of male life history traits was central to the emergence of the genus Homo. Compared with earlier hominins, changes in the behavioral and physiological mechanics of growth, survivorship, reproductive effort, and senescence all likely contributed to shifts in how males contributed to the evolution of our genus. For example, the range of paternal investment in modern Homo sapiens is unusual compared with most mammals and primates, all but certainly contributing to the evolution of the suite of life history traits that define Homo, including high fertility, large bodies, altricial offspring, large brains, and long lives. Moreover, the extensive range of phenotypic and behavioral variation in somatic and behavioral reflections of male reproductive effort across modern H. sapiens is especially noteworthy. We propose that selection for a broad range of variation in traits reflective of male reproductive effort was important to the evolution of Homo. We examine factors that contribute to this variation, proposing that selection for paternal and somatic investment plasticity across the entire male life span was important for the evolution of Homo. Potential research strategies and directions for new research for exploring these issues in the fossil record are also discussed.},

We find that a content bias favoring the preferential retention of danger and toxicity information continues to operate in older children, but that the magnitude of the bias diminishes with age and is absent in adults. We also find evidence that fitness costs likely impact the types of mistakes that participants make in their attributions of dangerousness and poisonousness. These results suggest that natural selection has shaped the way in which we learn and make inferences about unfamiliar animal species over ontogeny, and that future research is needed on how content biases may vary across the life course.},

We aim to shed light on some of the difficult ethical quandaries of this type of research.

  abstract = {The study of the medieval towns of Scotland has begun to advance on several fronts during the last decade. St Andrews provides an ideal opportunity for an interdisciplinary study combining topographical, cartographic, historical and archaeological evidence. A recently rediscovered panoramic sketch plan of St Andrews, which was drawn about the year 1580, shows in unique and surprisingly accurate detail the buildings and layout of a medieval Scottish burgh. It witnesses the variety of the functions of the town--ecclesiastical, educational and commercial--and testifies to the absence of any overall burgh defences. But the plan gives a misleading impression of the regularity of the layout of the town. Closer analysis of the street and plot pattern reveals four phases in the planning of the burgh, which can be dated from historical and archaeological evidence. It is also possible to suggest the nature and location of the pre-burghal nucleus in the ecclesiastical precinct of Kinrimund. But from the moment of its foundation as a burgh in circa 1150, St Andrews took on an ambitious two-street form, in which there was careful planning and control of street alignments and of the size of burgage plots. St Andrews was a planned town from that time onwards; it fits the pattern of the 'planted' town of medieval Europe of the twelfth and later centuries.},

Several theories have been posited to account for the nature of asexuality. The goal of this review was to consider the evidence for whether asexuality is best classified as a psychiatric syndrome (or a symptom of one), a sexual dysfunction, or a paraphilia. Based on the available science, we believe there is not sufficient evidence to support the categorization of asexuality as a psychiatric condition (or symptom of one) or as a disorder of sexual desire. There is some evidence that a subset of self-identified asexuals have a paraphilia. We also considered evidence supportingtheclassification ofasexuality asauniquesexual orientation. We conclude that asexuality is a heterogeneous entity that likely meets conditions for a sexual orientation, and that researchers should further explore evidence for such a categorization.},

  abstract = {Background and Objectives: Breastfeeding is an important form of parental investment with clear health benefits. Despite this, rates remain low in the UK; understanding variation can therefore help improve interventions. Life history theory suggests that environmental quality may pattern maternal investment, including breastfeeding. We analyse a nationally representative dataset to test two predictions: (i) higher local environmental quality predicts higher likelihood of breastfeeding initiation and longer duration; (ii) higher socioeconomic status (SES) provides a buffer against the adverse influences of low local environmental quality. Methodology: We ran factor analysis on a wide range of local-level environmental variables. Two summary measures of local environmental quality were generated by this analysis\textemdash one `objective' (based on an independent assessor's neighbourhood scores) and one `subjective' (based on respondent's scores). We used mixed-effects regression techniques to test our hypotheses. Results: Higher objective, but not subjective, local environmental quality predicts higher likelihood of starting and maintaining breastfeeding over and above individual SES and area-level measures of environmental quality. Higher individual SES is protective, with women from high-income households having relatively high breastfeeding initiation rates and those with high status jobs being more likely to maintain breastfeeding, even in poor environmental conditions. Conclusions and Implications: Environmental quality is often vaguely measured; here we present a thorough investigation of environmental quality at the local level, controlling for individual- and area-level measures. Our findings support a shift in focus away from individual factors and towards altering the landscape of women's decision making contexts when considering behaviours relevant to public health.},

Participants assessed potential mental distress of hypothetical military service members who varied in fWHR and indicated their willingness to assess and treat these symptoms. Formidable men were inferred as mentally tough, further biasing perceptions of them as not experiencing mental distress and not receiving subsequent care. We further replicated infrahumanization effects surrounding formidable men demonstrating individuals perceive them as less capable of feeling complex emotions, though treatment recommendations were driven by mental toughness perceptions rather than infrahumanization. Results are framed from an evolutionary perspective of affordance judgments. We discuss translational implications for clinical mental health.},

  abstract = {Human milk contains many bioactive components, including bacteria, which are transferred to the developing infant through breastfeeding. Milk bacteria appear to, amongst others, originate from the maternal gut. A mother's postnatal psychosocial distress may alter maternal gut microbiota, which in turn may affect the bacteria present in milk. The aim of this study was to explore whether maternal postnatal psychosocial distress was related to alterations in the relative abundances of specific bacteria and to milk microbial diversity. Healthy mothers (N = 77; N = 51 with complete data) collected breast milk samples at 2, 6, and 12 weeks postpartum and filled in mood questionnaires on experienced stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms at 6 weeks postpartum. A metataxonomic approach (16S rRNA gene sequencing (region V3 and V4) using Illumina MiSeq technology) was used to assess bacterial abundances and diversity. For the group as a whole, an increase in diversity of the milk bacterial community was observed during the first 3 months of breastfeeding (Shannon index). This general increase in diversity appears to be explained by an increase of Lactobacillus and other minor genera, together with a decrease in Staphylococcus. With respect to psychological distress and milk microbial composition, no significant differences in the relative abundance of major bacterial genera were detected between women with high (N = 13) and low (N = 13) psychosocial distress. However, progressive and distinct changes in the content of Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes at the phylum level and Acinetobacter, Flavobacterium, and Lactobacillus at the genera level were observed in milk samples of women with low psychosocial distress. With respect to milk microbial diversity, high maternal psychosocial distress, compared to low maternal psychosocial distress, was related to significantly lower bacterial diversity in milk at 3 months post-delivery. Anxiety, stress, and depressive symptoms separately were unrelated to specific bacterial profiles. The current study suggests a potential relation between maternal psychosocial distress and milk microbiota, providing first evidence of a possible mechanism through which post-partum psychological symptoms may affect infant development and health.},

Stressful life events are an important research focus and a psychometrically valid measure could provide useful clinical information. The purpose of the study was to develop a reliable and valid measurement of stressful life events and to assess its reliability and validity using established measures of social support, stress, depression, anxiety and maternal and child health. Methods The authors used an adaptation from the Social Readjustment Rating Scale (SRRS) to describe the prevalence of life events; they developed a 4-factor stressful life events subscales and used Medical Outcomes Social Support Scale, Social Support Scale, Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale and 14 general health items for validity analysis. Analyses were performed with descriptive statistics, Cronbach's alpha, Spearman's rho, Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test and Wilcoxon 2-sample test. Results The 4-factor stressful life events subscales showed acceptable reliability. The resulting subscale scores were significantly associated with established measures of social support, depression, anxiety, stress, and caregiver health indicators. Limitations The study presented a number of limitations in terms of design and recall bias. Conclusions Despite the presence of a number of limitations, the study provided valuable insight and suggested that further investigation is needed in order to determine the effectiveness of the measures in revealing the family's wellbeing and to develop and strengthen a more detailed analysis of the stressful life events/health association.},

First-trimester size was expressed as the difference between the observed and expected size of the fetus, expressed as equivalence to days of gestational age. The authors evaluated the association between fetal sex, first-trimester size, and birth weight. Eight to 12 weeks after conception, males were larger than females (mean difference: assisted conception = 0.4 days, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.1, 0.7, p = 0.008; spontaneous conception = 0.3 days, 95\% CI: 0.2, 0.4, p \&lt; 0.00001).

Functionally, intertemporal choices between smaller but immediate and larger but delayed rewards may be made without such episodic foresight. However, we propose that explicit simulations of this sort enable more flexible and adaptive intertemporal decision-making. Emotions triggered through the simulation of future situations can motivate people to forego immediate pleasures in the pursuit of long-term rewards. However, we stress that the most adaptive option need not always be a larger later reward. When the future is anticipated to be uncertain, for instance, it may make sense for preferences to shift toward more immediate rewards, instead. Imagining potential future scenarios and assessment of their likelihood and affective consequences allows humans to determine when it is more adaptive to delay gratification in pursuit of a larger later reward, and when the better strategy is to indulge in a present temptation. We discuss clinical studies that highlight when and how the effect of episodic foresight on intertemporal decision-making can be altered, and consider the relevance of this perspective to understanding the nature of self-control.},

  abstract = {Synopsis This essay provides reflections and insights on the sometimes complicated methodological and ethical issues involved in conducting feminist interviews with abused women and other trauma survivors. I begin by summarizing the development of conventional, positivist-informed standards of research methods and ethics as represented by federal regulations and university Institutional Review Boards (IRBs). Next I describe the post-positivist feminist critique of these standards and highlight several guiding principles of feminist research methodology. I then consider whether survivors of violent victimization are appropriately considered vulnerable research populations, and provide examples from my own research with abused women that allow for researcher reflexivity about the ethical considerations of researching traumatic topics like intimate partner abuse (IPA). Finally, I conclude by offering suggestions for feminist interview strategies designed to help empower rather than simply protect participants.},

Humans have evolved a psychology of tactical deployment designed to influence a partner's behavior to be closer to the actor's own optimum.

We discuss adaptive problems toward which cost-inflicting violent tactics are utilized: mate poachers, sexual infidelity, mate pregnancy by an intrasexual rival, resource infidelity, resource scarcity, mate value discrepancies, stepchildren, relationship termination, and mate reacquisition. Discussion focuses on the context-dependence of intimate partner violence, the costs of perpetrating violent tactics, the underlying psychology of aggressors, the manipulated psychology of victims, and co-evolved defenses to prevent intimate partner violence and to minimize its costs when it occurs.},

Although the relationship between anger and dominance has strong empirical support, most studies have focused on visual cues of dominance. Across two experiments, we tested the hypothesis that anger increases dominance-seeking and agonistic behaviors in those who feel it. In the first experiment (n\,=\,82), we induced anger through a hostile mock debate and measured corrugator electromyographic activity, testosterone and cortisol levels, status-seeking tendency, and aggression using behavioral tasks. Compared with the control group, the anger group showed higher levels of aggression and status seeking, with the moderator effect of anger intensity. In the second experiment (n\,=\,162), anger, fear, sadness, and neutral state were induced by film clips, after which dominance-related behavioral tendencies were assessed. The anger group showed higher dominance scores, differing significantly from the fear, sadness, and/or control groups. These findings reinforce the notion that feelings of anger can cause an increase in status-seeking and agonistic behaviors, leading to possible action tendencies for the establishment of dominance hierarchies.},

  abstract = {Background Women's suicide is a serious public health issue in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). This study explored whether institutional discrimination against women, as manifested in formal and informal laws, is relevant to country's income-level variability in women's suicide mortality. It also examined which discriminatory laws are associated with LMIC women's suicides. Methods Scores on laws discriminating against women, across 176 countries, were obtained from the Gender, Institutions and Development Database. Male-to-female (M/F) 2017 suicide ratios were the index of women's propensity for suicide. The mediating role of laws discriminating against women on the association between country's income level and M/F suicide ratio was analysed by bootstrapping method. Regression analyses examined which discriminatory laws were associated with LMIC women's suicide rates. Results LMIC had significantly smaller M/F suicide ratios than high-income countries. Institutional discrimination mediated the association between country's income-level and M/F suicide ratio (total effect: {$\beta~$}=~-0.13, 95\% CI [ -0.26, -0.01]; direct effect: {$\beta~$}=~-0.06, 95\% CI [ -0.20, 0.08]; indirect effect: {$\beta~$}=~-0.07, 95\% CI [ -0.15, -0.02]). In LMIC, higher levels of discrimination against women in laws about access to productive and financial resources ({$\beta~$}=~-0.69, p~{$<~$}0.001), civil liberties ({$\beta~$}=~-0.60, p~{$<~$}0.001), and in family law ({$\beta~$}=~-0.57, p~{$<~$}0.001) were associated with smaller M/F suicide ratios after controlling for male suicide rates and sex ratios at birth. Conclusions The relatively high suicide rates recorded among women in LMIC might be related to the higher level of institutional discrimination women experience in these countries. In LMIC, where, by law, women had restricted access to productive and financial assets and to justice, and/or unequal rights with regard to citizenship, household-responsibilities, divorce, and inheritance, M/F suicide ratios were lower\textemdash that is, women's suicide rates were higher. Suicide theory, research, and prevention targeting women should incorporate social-context and social-justice perspectives.},

This did not change at the 6-month follow-up. An ecological, longitudinal model was evaluated to predict battered women's depression 8 1/2 months postshelter exit. Results of hierarchical regression analyses suggested that, after controlling for previous levels of depression, the women's feelings of powerlessness, experience of abuse, and decreased social support contributed to their depression symptoms. The women's scores on these three variables (feelings of powerlessness, abuse, and social support) at 10 weeks postshelter exit and at 6-month follow-up predicted depression at 6 months. Thus, there were both predictive and concurrent effects for these constructs. Implications for clinical and community interventions are discussed.},

Men exceeded women on direct aggression and explosive acts, whereas women exceeded men on defusing acts. Expressive beliefs about aggression (as a loss of self-control) were higher among women and strongly associated with use of defusing acts and the avoidance of direct aggression. Instrumental beliefs about aggression (as a means of control over others) were higher among men and showed the opposite pattern of associations.

While women suffer from greater levels of mental health disorders, it remains unclear whether this gender gap differs systematically across regions and/or countries, or across the different dimensions of mental health. We analysed 2018 data from 566,829 adolescents across 73 countries for 4 mental health outcomes: psychological distress, life satisfaction, eudaemonia, and hedonia. We examine average gender differences and distributions for each of these outcomes as well as country-level associations between each outcome and purported determinants at the country level: wealth (GDP per capita), inequality (Gini index), and societal indicators of gender inequality (GII, GGGI, and GSNI). We report four main results: 1) The gender gap in mental health in adolescence is largely ubiquitous cross-culturally, with girls having worse average mental health; 2) There is considerable cross-national heterogeneity in the size of the gender gap, with the direction reversed in a minority of countries; 3) Higher GDP per capita is associated with worse average mental health and a larger gender gap across all mental health outcomes; and 4) more gender equal countries have larger gender gaps across all mental health outcomes. Taken together, our findings suggest that while the gender gap appears largely ubiquitous, its size differs considerably by region, country, and dimension of mental health. Findings point to the hitherto unrealised complex nature of gender disparities in mental health and possible incongruence between expectations and reality in high gender equal countries.},

Methods 110 cases of mothers killing 123 of their own offspring from 1976 to 2010 were analyzed. Each case was classified using 13 dichotomic variables. Descriptive statistics and hierarchical cluster analysis were performed both for cases and variables, and significant differences between clusters were analyzed. Results The Italian sample of neonaticides (killings of children within the first day of life) was found to satisfy all evolutionary predictions for an evolved behavioral, emotional and motivational pattern to increase fitness, showing a consistent profile for offending mothers. Relatively young, poor women with no partner kill their offspring non-violently, either directly or through abandonment, and they attempt to conceal the body. These women have no psychopathologies and never attempt suicide after killing their children. All neonaticide cases fall in a single cluster that is distinct from all other offspring killings by mothers. Infanticide (killing of children within the first year of life) and filicide (killing of children after the first year of life) do not significantly differ according to any of the variables measured. The common profile of mothers who have committed infanticide or filicide includes psychopathology, suicide or attempted suicide after killing their children, violent killing of their victims, and no attempt to conceal the victims' bodies. These results suggest that maternal infanticide and filicide represent an improper functioning of adaptation, and their profile are much more variable than those of neonaticide offenders. Conclusion Our study confirms that only neonaticide is an adaptive reproductive disinvestment, possibly evolved in the remote past, to increase the biological fitness of the mother by eliminating an unwanted newborn and saving resources for future offspring born in better conditions. Neonaticide is shown to be clearly distinct from infanticide and filicide and therefore should be approached, prevented, and judged differently.},

Organized by levels of a dynamic developmental systems perspective, risk factors included: (a) contextual characteristics of partners (demographic, neighborhood, community and school factors), (b) developmental characteristics and behaviors of the partners (e.g., family, peer, psychological/behavioral, and cognitive factors), and (c) relationship influences and interactional patterns. Comparisons to a prior review highlight developments in the field in the past 10 years. Recommendations for intervention and policy along with future directions for intimate partner violence (IPV) risk factor research are presented.},

  abstract = {Recent research suggests that the effect of age at first birth on mental health for women is curvilinear, with first births at both young (age 20 and younger) and older ages (after age 30) being positively associated with psychological distress. Scholars have theorized that accumulated disadvantages and physical health problems associated with age at first birth explain this pattern, although empirical support for these explanations has varied. Using data from the US National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979, this study provides evidence of an alternative explanation for this curvilinear relationship through its focus on: 1) the relationship between deviations from expected age at first birth and women's actual age at first birth, and 2) the effect deviations from expected age at first birth have on mental health. Results indicate that deviating from their expected age at first birth results in higher levels of depressive symptoms for women in midlife who transition into parenthood both earlier and later than expected. These deviations from expected birth timing account for the upward trend in depressive symptoms at older ages of first birth, but explain only a small amount of the higher levels of depressive symptoms at younger ages.},

The original explanation for this costly helping behaviour invoked both direct and indirect fitness benefits. Several authors have since suggested that food sharing is maintained solely by indirect fitness because non-kin food sharing could have resulted from kin recognition errors, indiscriminate altruism within groups, or harassment. To test these alternatives, we examined predictors of food-sharing decisions under controlled conditions of mixed relatedness and equal familiarity. Over a 2 year period, we individually fasted 20 vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) and induced food sharing on 48 days. Surprisingly, donors initiated food sharing more often than recipients, which is inconsistent with harassment. Food received was the best predictor of food given across dyads, and 8.5 times more important than relatedness. Sixty-four per cent of sharing dyads were unrelated, approaching the 67 per cent expected if nepotism was absent. Consistent with social bonding, the food-sharing network was consistent and correlated with mutual allogrooming. Together with past work, these findings support the hypothesis that food sharing in vampire bats provides mutual direct fitness benefits, and is not explained solely by kin selection or harassment.},

We examined data from 10,149 adults representative of the U.S. population (4858 non-Hispanic White, 1978 non-Hispanic Black, 2260 Mexican American, 1053 Other Hispanic) who participated in the cross-sectional National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey between 2005 and 2010. Depressive symptoms were assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and high-sensitivity serum CRP was quantified by latex-enhanced nephelometry. Total (p{$<$}.001), somatic (p{$<$}.001), and nonsomatic (p=.001) depressive symptoms were each positively related to serum CRP in individual models. However, in the simultaneous model that included both symptom clusters, somatic symptoms (p{$<$}.001), but not nonsomatic symptoms (p=.98), remained associated with serum CRP. Evidence of moderation by race/ethnicity was also observed, as six of the nine depressive symptoms\texttimes race/ethnicity interactions were significant (ps{$<$}.05). Among non-Hispanic Whites, the pattern of results was identical to the full sample; only somatic symptoms (p{$<$}.001) remained related to serum CRP in the simultaneous model. No relationships between total, somatic, or nonsomatic symptoms and serum CRP were observed among the non-Hispanic Black, Mexican American, or Other Hispanic groups. Our findings indicate that the link between depressive symptoms and systemic inflammation may be due to the somatic symptoms of sleep disturbance, fatigue, appetite changes, and psychomotor retardation/agitation and may be strongest among non-Hispanic Whites.},

Throughout, they seek to answer intricate yet fundamental questions about why we are motivated to find meaning in everything around us and, in turn, how we constitute the cultural worlds we inhabit through our intentional involvement in them. Laying bare entrenched disciplinary blind spots, this book offers a trove of insights on issues such as morality, emotional functioning, and conceptions of the self across cultures.

An expected consequence of sexual conflict is male aggression towards mates. Considering how complex measurements and interpretations of behaviours such as sexual aggression and sexual coercion are, I preferred to define operationally, as `sexual disturbance', any male behaviour towards females during the pericopulatory period that can be costly for females. The objectives in this review were as follows: 1) to estimate how widespread sexual disturbance is among mammals, 2) to analyse the types of female response to sexual disturbance, and 3) to characterise the costs of sexual disturbance to females. I conducted a systematic review by searching the literature in the Web of Knowledge database using the search tools available for 19 main journals, and I conducted a qualitative review via a taxon-by-taxon analysis. Sexual disturbance was frequent in four of the 32 mammalian orders: Primates, Artiodactyla, Carnivora, and Cetacea, which all include highly polygynous taxa. The most common expression of sexual conflict around copulation is seen in behaviours associated with female retention attempts that cause minor harm. Research suggests that the most common response of females to sexual disturbance comprises female grouping around a dominant male.},

Method: Participants were 6\textendash 9 year old children with ADHD (n = 57) and without ADHD (n = 59). Using a selectivity task, participants studied words paired with point values and were asked to maximize their score, which was the overall value of the items they recalled. This task allows for measures of memory capacity and the ability to selectively remember high-value items. Results: Although there were no significant between-groups differences in the number of words recalled (memory capacity), children with ADHD were less selective than children in the control group in terms of the value of the items they recalled (control of memory). All children recalled more high-value items than low-value items and showed some learning with task experience, but children with ADHD Combined type did not efficiently maximize memory performance (as measured by a selectivity index) relative to children with ADHD Inattentive type and healthy controls, who did not differ significantly from one another. Conclusions: Children with ADHD Combined type exhibit impairments in the strategic and efficient encoding and recall of high-value items. The findings have implications for theories of memory dysfunction in childhood ADHD and the key role of metacognition, cognitive control, and value-directed remembering when considering the strategic use of memory.},

The type of relationship between victim, perpetrator, and the victim's mother was a particular interest. Methods Data were gathered from 26 cases of fatal child abuse perpetrated by fathers derived from the wider Murder in Britain study.****The Murder in Britain study was supported by an ESRC grant. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected from extensive prison case files of men serving life sentences for child murder. Results This was a group of undereducated, underemployed men with significant criminal histories. All except one victim had been subjected to previous violence by the offender, almost three-quarter of whom had also perpetrated violence against their intimate partners (the child's birth mother). Many men had unreasonable expectations and low tolerance levels of normal childhood behaviors, and many appeared jealous and resentful of these young children. All 26 victims were under 4 years of age. Sixty-two percent of the offenders were stepfathers and in only four cases was the perpetrator a birth father married to the birth mother. Stepfathers had more disrupted and disadvantaged backgrounds and experiences than birth fathers. Conclusions Findings suggest that fathers who perpetrate fatal child abuse have a propensity to use violence against children in their care and intimate partners, raising questions about the gender dynamics and generational boundaries operating in these families. The nature and type of intimate relationship (whether married or cohabiting) and fathering relationship (whether birth or de facto) were important differentiating factors in these homicides as well as characteristics of the offender. Practice implications Professionals working in child protection strive to provide effective services to children and families, ever vigilant to the possibility of the death of a child as a consequence of an assault. By and large, fathers (either biological or de facro) as the perpetrators of such assaults have received minimal attention in both policy and practice. Findings from this study suggest that practitioners need to be cognisant of men's attitudes towards and excpeectations of fathering (particularly stepfathering) which may present increased levels of risk to both children and intimate partners.},

  abstract = {Since the turn of the century, interdisciplinary research on networks-their formation, structure, and influence-has advanced so rapidly, it is now a science unto itself, offering new and powerful quantitative tools for studying human behavior, whose potential psychologists are just beginning to glimpse. Among these tools is a formula for quantifying assortativity, the propensity of similar people to be socially connected with one another more often than their dissimilar counterparts. With this formula, this investigation establishes a foundation for examining assortative patterns in suicidal behavior and highlights how they can be exploited for improved prevention. Specifically, the established clustering of suicide fatalities in time and space implies such fatalities have assortative features. This suggests other forms of suicide-related behavior may as well. Thus, the assortativity of suicide-related verbalizations (SRVs) was examined by machine coding 64 million posts from 17 million users of a large social media platform-Twitter-over 2 distinct 28-day periods. Users were defined as socially linked in the network if they mutually replied to each other at least once. Results show SRVs were significantly more assortative than chance, through 6 degrees of separation. This implies that if a person posts SRVs, their friends' friends' friends' friends' friends' friends are more likely than chance to do the same even though they have never met. SRVs also remained significantly assortative through 2 degrees, even when mood was controlled. Discussion illustrates how these assortative patterns can be exploited to improve the true-positive rate of suicide risk screenings. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).},

  abstract = {Objective With the increasingly permissive legal and social environments regarding marijuana, it is important to understand prenatal marijuana use from the perspective of women who use marijuana. Our objective was to qualitatively describe the marijuana use experiences, beliefs, and attitudes of women who used marijuana during pregnancy. Methods We conducted semi-structured interviews with pregnant women who had either reported current marijuana use or had urine testing positive for marijuana. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed for patterns and themes. Results Twenty-five pregnant women who used marijuana during their pregnancies participated in our study interviews. Main themes that emerged from the interviews were that women: 1) reported higher amounts of marijuana use prior to pregnancy and attempted to reduce their use once they realized they were pregnant; 2) used marijuana to help with nausea and appetite changes during pregnancy or to improve mood; 3) described marijuana as ``natural'' and ``safe'' compared to other substances such as alcohol, tobacco, other recreational drugs, and prescribed medications; 4) had conflicting opinions regarding whether marijuana was addictive; and 5) were uncertain but had some concerns regarding potential risks of prenatal marijuana use. Conclusion Pregnant women who used marijuana in pregnancy held contradictory beliefs about continued use; they reported trying to reduce usage and were worried about potential risks, but also felt that marijuana is more natural and safer than other substances, including prescribed medicines. These findings have implications for how practitioners address prenatal marijuana use and highlight the need for further research on developmental outcomes.},

We also searched the grey literature, such as government reports, conference proceedings, and dissertations, to source additional data, and we searched datasets from existing literature reviews of the global prevalence of depression and anxiety and reference lists from the studies that were identified.

In recent years we have developed a general theory of life history that interrelates many aspects of ontogeny and reproduction across a wide range of organisms. Contrasted to most other mammals, primates have long average adult lifespans and few babies per year for their adult body size. This new theory suggests that these aspects of life history follow directly from the fact that primates have slow individual growth rates. This slow growth rate is thus the basic phenomenon that needs explanation to understand primate slowness.},

  abstract = {Objective This study examined the longitudinal association between parental warmth and offspring flourishing in mid-life. We also considered associations between parental warmth and a number of mental health problems and adverse health behavioral outcomes. Method Longitudinal data from the Midlife in the United States Study (N\,=\,3,929, mean baseline age\,=\,47.4 years) were analyzed using generalized estimating equations. Parental warmth in childhood was recalled at phase I (1995\textendash 1996), while flourishing and other outcomes were self-reported at phase II (2004\textendash 2006). Following an approach developed by Keyes, flourishing was operationalized as a combined measure incorporating assessments of three aspects of well-being, including emotional, psychological, and social well-being. Results The results suggest that parental warmth was positively associated with the continuous score of flourishing (B\,=\,0.21, 95\% CI\,=\,0.18, 0.25). The association was not specific to any particular component (emotional, psychological, or social well-being) or subdomain of flourishing. Parental warmth was also inversely associated with several adverse health behavior outcomes such as drug use and smoking. Conclusions Parental warmth in childhood may help promote offspring functioning across multiple domains of well-being in mid-life. The findings help to strengthen the call for a public health focus on the importance of parenting for outcomes beyond childhood and well into adulthood, and suggest the value of targeting parenting practices for prevention and intervention strategies to improve population health and well-being.},

  abstract = {Hormonal pain modulation Men and women experience pain differently. However, the mechanisms mediating this difference are unclear. The short isoform of the prolactin (PRL) receptor (PRLR-S), but not the long isoform (PRLR-L), has been shown to regulate the excitability of sensory neurons in female rodents. Here, Chen et al. studied opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH) and reported that opioid administration, but not trauma-induced nerve injury, augmented PRL and decreased PRLR-L in female animals, promoting the activation of PRLR-S and the development of OIH. PRL inhibition prevented the occurrence of OIH in female animals. The results suggest that targeting PRL signaling might be an effective therapy for preventing OIH in women. Pain is more prevalent in women for reasons that remain unclear. We have identified a mechanism of injury-free nociceptor sensitization and opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH) promoted by prolactin (PRL) in females. PRL signals through mutually inhibitory long (PRLR-L) and short (PRLR-S) receptor isoforms, and PRLR-S activation induces neuronal excitability. PRL and PRLR expression were higher in females. CRISPR-mediated editing of PRLR-L promoted nociceptor sensitization and allodynia in na\"ive, uninjured female mice that depended on circulating PRL. Opioids, but not trauma-induced nerve injury, decreased PRLR-L promoting OIH through activation of PRLR-S in female mice. Deletion of both PRLR-L and PRLR-S (total PRLR) prevented, whereas PRLR-L overexpression rescued established OIH selectively in females. Inhibition of circulating PRL with cabergoline, a dopamine D2 agonist, up-regulated PRLR-L and prevented OIH only in females. The PRLR-L isoform therefore confers protection against PRL-promoted pain in females. Limiting PRL/PRLR-S signaling pharmacologically or with gene therapies targeting the PRLR may be effective for reducing pain in a female-selective manner. Female selective nociceptor sensitization and opioid-induced hyperalgesia result from an imbalance of prolactin receptor isoforms. Female selective nociceptor sensitization and opioid-induced hyperalgesia result from an imbalance of prolactin receptor isoforms.},

  abstract = {The pursuit of social status is a recurrent and pervasive challenge faced by individuals in all human societies. Yet, the precise means through which individuals compete for and effectively acquire social standing remains unclear. Despite a large literature examining the factors that lead to rank differentiation, this body of work currently lacks a unifying framework. The current chapter addresses this gap by proposing the adoption of the Dominance-Prestige Account, an evolutionary framework that proposes two distinct pathways to rank attainment in human societies: dominance, or the use of force and intimidation to induce fear, and prestige, or the sharing of expertise or know-how to gain respect. Here, we show how this account provides a parsimonious explanation for the large body of previously disconnected findings that have emerged on rank attainment, and demonstrate that it offers the additional benefit of explaining why various behaviors, traits, and attributes effectively promote rank, rather than simply describe which of these factors promote rank. In light of its parsimony and explanatory power, we advocate the Dominance-Prestige Account as an empirically grounded framework for organizing, understanding, and generating research on human social rank dynamics.},

  abstract = {Background: Recently discovered relationships between the gastrointestinal microbiome and the brain have implications for psychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD). Bacterial transplantation from MDD patients to rodents produces depression-like behaviors. In humans, case-control studies have examined the gut microbiome in healthy and affected individuals. We systematically reviewed existing studies comparing gut microbial composition in MDD and healthy volunteers. Methods: A PubMed literature search combined the terms ``depression,'' ``depressive disorder,'' ``stool,'' ``fecal,'' ``gut,'' and ``microbiome'' to identify human case-control studies that investigated relationships between MDD and microbiota quantified from stool. We evaluated the resulting studies, focusing on bacterial taxa that were different between MDD and healthy controls. Results: Six eligible studies were found in which 50 taxa exhibited differences (p{$<$}0.05) between patients with MDD and controls. Patient characteristics and methodologies varied widely between studies. Five phyla\textemdash Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Fusobacteria and Protobacteria\textemdash were represented; however, divergent results occurred across studies for all phyla. The largest number of differentiating taxa were within phylum Firmicutes, in which nine families and twelve genera differentiated the diagnostic groups. The majority of these families and genera were found to be statistically different between the two groups in two studies identified. Family Lachnospiraceae differentiated the diagnostic groups in four studies (with an even split in directionality). Across all five phyla, nine genera were higher in MDD (Anaerostipes, Blautia, Clostridium, Klebsiella, Lachnospiraceae incertae sedis, Parabacteroides, Parasuterella, Phascolarctobacterium, and Streptococcus), six were lower (Bifidobacterium, Dialister, Escherichia/Shigella, Faecalibacterium, and Ruminococcus), and six were divergent (Alistipes, Bacteroides, Megamonas, Oscillibacter, Prevotella, and Roseburia). We highlight mechanisms and products of bacterial metabolism as they may relate to the etiology of depression. Conclusions: No consensus has emerged from existing human studies of depression and gut microbiome concerning which bacterial taxa are most relevant to depression. This may in part be due to differences in study design. Given that bacterial functions are conserved across taxonomic groups, we propose that studying microbial functioning may be more productive than a purely taxonomic approach to understanding the gut microbiome in depression.},

  abstract = {Intimate partner violence is a significant public health problem in our society, affecting women disproportionately. Intimate partner violence takes many forms, including physical violence, sexual violence, stalking, and psychological aggression. While the scope of intimate partner violence is not fully documented, nearly 40\% of women in the United States are victims of sexual violence in their lifetimes and 20\% are victims of physical intimate partner violence. Other forms of intimate partner violence are likely particularly underreported. Intimate partner violence has a substantial impact on a woman's physical and mental health. Physical disorders include the direct consequences of injuries sustained after physical violence, such as fractures, lacerations and head trauma, sexually transmitted infections and unintended pregnancies as a consequence of sexual violence, and various pain disorders. Mental health impacts include an increased risk of depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, and suicide. These adverse health effects are amplified in pregnancy, with an increased risk of pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth, low birthweight, and small for gestational age. In many US localities, suicide and homicide are leading causes of pregnancy-associated mortality. We herein review the issues noted previously in greater depth and introduce the basic principles of intimate partner violence prevention. We separately address current recommendations for intimate partner violence screening and the evidence surrounding effectiveness of intimate partner violence interventions.},

Racine v Woods reflected knowledge of attachment and family at that time but runs counter to current knowledge. Reconsideration of the factors to decide cross-cultural adoption is needed. The essential point is that attachment assessment draws from a dyadic relational theory and is being applied to communal family systems, such as Indigenous systems. Such a review is consistent with the calls to action of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) as well as its predecessor, the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (RCAP), and recent Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (CHRT) decisions.},

Methods Data came from the 2012\textendash 2013 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (N = 36,309 respondents aged 18+). Logistic regression models were used to examine age group differences in associations of substance use and mental disorders and health conditions with medical versus nonmedical marijuana use. Results Of all respondents, 9.74\% (N = 3,784) reported past-year marijuana use. Of all past-year marijuana users, 11.03\% (n = 445) reported medical use. Medical marijuana use rates were higher among the 50\textendash 64 age group (17.95\%) than younger adults, and 32.88\% of medical users, compared to 25.25\% of nonmedical users, had past-year marijuana use disorder. The odds of medical marijuana use were higher among those with marijuana use disorder (OR = 1.87, 95\% CI = 1.40\textendash 2.50) and personality disorder (OR = 1.42, 95\% CI = 1.03\textendash 1.94), with no age group differences. However, older adults with alcohol use disorder and sleep problems and middle-age adults with arthritis had diminished odds of having used medical marijuana relative to young adults. Conclusions and Scientific Significance Given the high rates of marijuana use disorder among medical users, physicians should exercise caution in recommending marijuana for medical purposes, especially for younger adults. More research is needed on medical marijuana's safety and efficacy for patients at risk of marijuana use disorder. (Am J Addict 2017;26:697\textendash 706)},

Methods A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane Library and CABI databases. Outcome estimates of odds ratios or relative risks or standardised mean differences were pooled. In cases of heterogeneity, subgroup analysis and meta-regression were explored. Results Breastfeeding {$>$}12 months was associated with reduced risk of breast and ovarian carcinoma by 26\% and 37\%, respectively. No conclusive evidence of an association between breastfeeding and bone mineral density was found. Breastfeeding was associated with 32\% lower risk of type 2 diabetes. Exclusive breastfeeding and predominant breastfeeding were associated with longer duration of amenorrhoea. Shorter duration of breastfeeding was associated with higher risk of postpartum depression. Evidence suggesting an association of breastfeeding with postpartum weight change was lacking. Conclusion This review supports the hypothesis that breastfeeding is protective against breast and ovarian carcinoma, and exclusive breastfeeding and predominant breastfeeding increase the duration of lactational amenorrhoea. There is evidence that breastfeeding reduces the risk of type 2 diabetes. However, an association between breastfeeding and bone mineral density or maternal depression or postpartum weight change was not evident.},

Moreover, this effect appears domain-sensitive: in Study 2 when bystanders preferentially observed a prestigious model using artifacts, she was learned from more often on subsequent artifact-use tasks (odds almost five times greater) but not on food-preference tasks, while the reverse was true of a model who received preferential bystander attention while expressing food preferences.},

Despite its importance across the behavioral sciences and for theories of cultural evolution, no attempts have been made, to our knowledge, to critically analyze this analogy. We here aim at such detailed comparison and show that the fundamental role of modes of transmission in biology results mainly from two properties of genetic transmission: (1) what is transmitted generally does not influence the way in which it is transmitted; (2) there is a limited number of simple and stable modes. In culture however, modes of transmission generally lack these two fundamental properties. In particular, in culture it is often the rate of evolutionary change that determines the mode of transmission. We offer some tentative explanation regarding the origins of such a fundamental difference and we conclude that cultural transmission modes are not causal mechanisms that govern the transmission of culture but mere descriptions of the way culture happens to be transmitted at a given time in a given community. This shows the limit of the analogy between biological and cultural evolution and suggests that evolutionary models and theories differ substantially between the two domains.},

Three nested subtypes of populational models can be distinguished: evolutionary, selectional and replicative. Substantial progress has been made in the study of cultural evolution by modelling it within the selectional frame. This progress has involved idealizing away from phenomena that may be critical to an adequate understanding of culture and cultural evolution, particularly the constructive aspect of the mechanisms of cultural transmission. Taking these aspects into account, we describe cultural evolution in terms of               cultural attraction               , which is populational and evolutionary, but only selectional under certain circumstances. As such, in order to model cultural evolution, we must not simply adjust existing replicative or selectional models but we should rather               generalize               them, so that, just as replicator-based selection is one form that Darwinian selection can take, selection itself is one of several different forms that attraction can take.

Previous work has analyzed the overt and hidden risks of harm to study participants through poorly designed and implemented protocols, cross-cultural insensitivity, unjust exclusion of certain victim types, and neglect to ensure safety of research staff. This article extends this work by calling for greater attention to exploiting participants and victims as a class of persons. The need for this wider view derives from concern about the academic research environment with its emphasis on research, publication, and extramural funding. The authors argue that compliance with federal regulations and IRB directives is necessary but insufficient to conduct truly ethical research. Recognition of the unique pressures that researchers face in the context of the economically competitive university is required to delineate and manage exploitation risks. Such pressures have sometimes led to the rush from print to practices and policies with unintended harmful results for victims of violence as a class of persons. The authors suggest a number of strategies for researchers to define and manage the dangers of engaging in this type of unethical conduct.},

They are bundles of cells that support perception and action by constantly attempting to match incoming sensory inputs with top-down expectations or predictions.

Such accounts offer a unifying model of perception and action, illuminate the functional role of attention, and may neatly capture the special contribution of cortical processing to adaptive success. This target article critically examines this ``hierarchical prediction machine'' approach, concluding that it offers the best clue yet to the shape of a unified science of mind and action. Sections 1 and 2 lay out the key elements and implications of the approach. Section 3 explores a variety of pitfalls and challenges, spanning the evidential, the methodological, and the more properly conceptual.

  abstract = {Many scholars have argued that religion reduces violent behavior within human social groups. Here, we tested whether intelligence moderates this relationship. We hypothesized that religion would have greater utility for regulating violent behavior among societies with relatively lower average IQs than among societies with relatively more cognitively gifted citizens. Two studies supported this hypothesis. Study 1, a longitudinal analysis from 1945 to 2010 (with up to 176 countries and 1,046 observations), demonstrated that declines in religiosity were associated with increases in homicide rates\textemdash but only in countries with relatively low average IQs. Study 2, a multiverse analysis (171 models) using modern data (97\textendash 195 countries) and various controls, consistently confirmed that lower rates of religiosity were more strongly associated with higher homicide rates in countries with lower average IQ. These findings raise questions about how secularization might differentially affect groups of different mean cognitive ability.},

  abstract = {Purpose: For good reason, the trajectory of contemporary research and therapy into rehabilitation following spinal cord injury (SCI) has moved away from focusing on the pathology of depression, to highlight the contribution of resiliency, optimism, and hope to long-term well-being. This article complements this literature, exploring the analogous links between the losses of SCI and the experiences of the grief that accompanies the death of a loved one. Method: The article uses autoethnography, drawing on the authors' writing about his own experiences as a C5 (incomplete) quadriplegic, to identify a correlation between the stages/symptoms of grief and the journey of rehabilitating from an SCI. Results: The article highlights the ``wild'' and ambiguous reality of adjusting to an SCI, and so challenges the dualist tendency to assume that people are either resilient or weak, successful or unsuccessful in their recovery. It recognises that adjusting to an SCI involves complex swings in emotion \textendash{} sadness, anger, and melancholy, alongside hope and determination. Conclusion: Drawing on strategies of grief therapy, the article suggests that constructing and reconstructing the story of one's own life is essential to learning to accept and live with an SCI. Implications for RehabilitationSince the losses accompanying SCI are analogous to grief, grief therapy strategies that recognise the complex and ambiguous nature of recovery can be part of rehabilitation.Therapy should encourage people to construct and reconstruct narratives \textendash{} life stories \textendash{} that help them mourn their loss and make sense of their new lives.The loss of an SCI is especially potent following return to the community, so storied therapy should continue beyond the period of the in-house rehabilitation.},

Method One-hundred-thirty-nine women completed the baseline questionnaire and 105 completed the follow-up questionnaire at 4\textendash 6 months postpartum. Sociodemographic and pregnancy factors were assessed at baseline, birth and postnatal factors were assessed at time 2, and depression, anxiety, and stress were assessed at both time points. Results Caesarean delivery was associated with high postpartum depression, anxiety, and stress levels. Child sleep problems was related to depression, child health problems were related to anxiety, more SLE related to high stress, and maternal sleep problems were related to PPD. However, the results became non-significant after controlling for antenatal distress levels. Finally, women who underwent caesarean delivery had higher antenatal stress, anxiety, and depression levels, relative to women who did not undergo the procedure. Conclusion Psychological stress and distress tended to persist in the women from the third-trimester of pregnancy to 4\textendash 6 months postpartum. It tended to occur in the context of caesarean delivery, maternal sleep problems, child's health and sleep problems, and stressful life-events.},

  abstract = {In most animals, members of one sex compete more intensely for mates than members of the other sex, and show a greater development of secondary sexual traits. The relative intensity of mating competition in the two sexes depends on the operational sex ratio (OSR) (the ratio of males that are ready to mate to females that are ready to mate) at the site and times when mating occurs. The extent and direction of biases in the OSR is closely related to the potential rates of reproduction that individual males and females can achieve, although the distribution of the two sexes in space and time, sex differences in development time or life expectancy, and biases in the sex ratio at birth or hatching can also be important. The potential rates of reproduction in the two sexes are, in turn, affected by the proportion of time and energy expended by male and female parents on their progeny, though other factors may constrain reproductive rate in one or both sexes. We outline a simple model of the factors affecting the OSR, where relative parental expenditure by the two sexes and the adult sex ratio are fixed, and a more complex model where the adult sex ratio varies in relation to the reproductive activity of the two sexes. This framework for relating sex differences in mating competition to the OSR, potential reproductive rates, and parental expenditure differs from Triver's concept of the relation between parental investment and mating competition in three ways: first, it identifies the OSR as the immediate factor determining which sex completes most intensely for mates; second, it recognizes that factors other than the future fitness costs of rearing offspring can affect the potential reproductive rate of the two sexes; third, it suggests an empirical measure (potential reproductive rate) that can be estimated in natural populations and used to predict the distribution of mating competition.}

  abstract = {Current thinking in life-history theory and the biology of ageing suggests that ageing rates, and consequently life spans, evolve largely as a function of trade-offs with reproduction. While various evolutionary constraints are generally acknowledged to exist, their potential role in determining ageing rates is rarely considered. This review integrates three types of information to assess the relative importance of constraints and trade-offs in shaping ageing rates: (a) empirical work on the presence of intraspecific trade-offs; (b) theoretical work on factors limiting the force of trade-offs; and (c) consideration of the biological mechanisms of ageing, as currently understood. At the empirical level, evidence for intraspecific trade-offs is mixed, including some surprising failures to observe a trade-off in model organisms. At the theoretical level, the presence of multiple currencies and nonlinearity can weaken the strength and/or generality of trade-offs. Additionally, trade-offs among lower-level functions, such as between sources of mortality, can create constraints at higher organizational levels, for example such that reductions in reproduction are unable to produce decreases in ageing rate. In terms of ageing mechanisms, some mechanisms, such as the regulation of IGF-1 and related pathways, seem to agree quite well with trade-offs as a driving force; however, other mechanisms, such as dysregulation of the vertebrate stress response and stem cell exhaustion, seem more likely to impose constraints than to mediate trade-offs. Taken together, these findings suggest that trade-offs alone are insufficient to understand how ageing rates evolve; instead, both trade-offs and constraints likely play important roles in shaping evolutionary patterns, with their relative importance varying across taxa. Accordingly, it is time to revisit the broad assumption that survival\textendash reproduction trade-offs are the key force structuring much of life-history variation and the evolution of ageing rates.

Despite extensive literature on participant expectancies and other potent psychosocial factors that perpetuate placebo response, no empirically validated participant-focused strategies to mitigate this phenomenon have been available. This study evaluated the efficacy of the Placebo-Control Reminder Script (PCRS), a brief interactive procedure that educates participants about factors known to cause placebo response, which~was administered prior to the primary outcome assessments to subjects with major depressive or psychotic disorders who had at least moderate depression. Participants were informed they would participate in a 2-week randomized clinical trial with a 50\% chance of receiving either an experimental antidepressant medication or placebo. In actuality, all participants received placebo. Participants randomly assigned to receive the PCRS (n\,=\,70) reported significantly smaller reductions (i.e., less placebo response) in depression than those who did not receive the PCRS (n\,=\,67). The magnitude of this effect was medium (Cohen's d\,=\,0.40) and was not significantly impacted by diagnostic status. The number of adverse events (i.e., nocebo effect) was also lower in the PCRS group, particularly in the first week of the study. These findings suggest that briefly educating participants about placebo response factors can help mitigate the large placebo response rates that are increasingly seen in failed CNS drug development programs.},

Recent findings suggest that some psychological resilience factors may help buffer CTRA activation, but the relative impact of resilience and adversity factors remains poorly understood. Here we examined the relative strength of CTRA association for the two best-established psychological correlates of CTRA gene expression\textemdash the risk factor of perceived social isolation (loneliness) and the resilience factor of eudaimonic well-being (purpose and meaning in life). Methods: Peripheral blood samples and validated measures of loneliness and eudaimonic well-being were analyzed in 108 community-dwelling older adults participating in the longitudinal US Health and Retirement Study (56\% female, mean age 73). Mixed effect linear model analyses quantified the strength of association between CTRA gene expression and measures of loneliness and eudaimonic well-being in separate and joint analyses. Results: As in previous studies, separate analyses found CTRA gene expression to be up-regulated in association with loneliness and down-regulated in association with eudaimonic well-being. In joint analyses, effects of loneliness were completely abrogated whereas eudaimonic well-being continued to associate with CTRA down-regulation. Similar eudaimonia-dominant effects were observed for positive and negative affect, optimism and pessimism, and anxiety symptoms. All results were independent of demographic and behavioral health risk factors. Conclusions: Eudaimonic well-being may have the potential to compensate for the adverse impact of loneliness on CTRA gene expression. Findings suggest a novel approach to targeting the health risks associated with social isolation by promoting purpose and meaning in life.},

Here, we examine this issue by evaluating four factors that may affect the diversity and complexity of the food-getting tools employed by hunter-gatherer populations: 1) the nature of the food resources; 2) risk of resource failure; 3) residential mobility; and 4) population size. We apply step-wise multiple regression analysis to technological and ecological data for 20 hunter-gatherer populations from several regions of the world. The analyses support the hypothesis that risk of resource failure has a significant impact on toolkit diversity and complexity. The results do not support the hypothesis that the characteristics of the resources exploited for food influence toolkit structure, or that residential mobility affects toolkit diversity and complexity. They are also not in line with the hypothesis that population size has an impact on toolkit structure. While our analyses appear to strongly support the suggestion that resource failure risk is the primary influence on hunter-gatherer toolkit structure, we argue that it would be premature to discount the other factors at this stage, and outline the steps that we believe need to be taken next.},

  abstract = {Evolutionary demography is a community of researchers in a range of different disciplines who agree that ``nothing in evolution makes sense except in the light of demography'' (Carey and Vaupel 2005). My focus here is a subset of this research (henceforth `evolutionary demography' or `evolutionary anthropology') that originated in anthropology in the late 1970s and which typically examines micro-level phenomena concerning reproductive decision-making and the evolutionary processes generating observed patterns in reproductive variation. Scholars in this area tend to be more involved in long-term anthropological fieldwork than any other area of the evolutionary sciences. But cardcarrying anthropologists are declining among their number as researchers increasingly come from other backgrounds in the biological and social sciences, with an associated decline in the contribution of ethnographic work. Most practitioners identify with the sub-field of human behavioral ecology \textendash{} the application of sociobiological principles to human behavior \textendash{} and distinguish themselves from the sister fields of evolutionary psychology and cultural evolution. Human behavioral ecology has been criticized for abstracting away the details of both culture and psychology in its focus on adaptive explanations of reproductive behavior, and for its commitment to ultimate over proximate causation. This chapter explores these critiques. Inspired by EA Hammel's seminal paper ``A theory of culture for demography'' (Hammel 1990), I examine how the culture concept is used in evolutionary research. Like Hammel, I argue that a theory of culture for evolutionary demography requires engaging more seriously with (and in) ethnographic work. I highlight some challenging examples to motivate discussion about adaptive reproduction and natural fertility. Going further, I advocate for cultural evolution as an integrative framework for bringing both culture and psychology into the core of evolutionary demography research. This will involve expanding our theoretical and conceptual toolkits: (1) building and testing proximate mechanistic models, (2) delineating and evaluating causal claims at multiple levels of analysis and time scales, and (3) exploring co-evolution or feedback between demography and culture.},

We used polygenic risk scores for major depressive disorder (MDD) calculated from the results of the most recent analysis from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium as a direct measure of the vulnerability for depression in a sample of 5221 individuals from 3083 families. In the same we also had measures of stressful life events and social support and a depression symptom score, as well as DSM-IV MDD diagnoses for most individuals. In order to estimate the variance in depression explained by the genetic vulnerability, the stressors and their interactions, we fitted linear mixed models controlling for relatedness for the whole sample as well as stratified by sex. We show a significant interaction of the polygenic risk scores with personal life events (0.12\% of variance explained, P-value=0.0076) contributing positively to the risk of depression. Additionally, our results suggest possible differences in the aetiology of depression between women and men. In conclusion, our findings point to an extra risk for individuals with combined vulnerability and high number of reported personal life events beyond what would be expected from the additive contributions of these factors to the liability for depression, supporting the multiplicative diathesis\textendash stress model for this disease.},

  abstract = {Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and ecological momentary intervention (EMI) are alternative approaches to retrospective self-reports and face-to-face treatments, and they make it possible to repeatedly assess patients in naturalistic settings and extend psychological support into real life. The increase in smartphone applications and the availability of low-cost wearable biosensors have further improved the potential of EMA and EMI, which, however, have not yet been applied in clinical practice. Here, we conducted a systematic review, using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, to explore the state of the art of technology-based EMA and EMI for major depressive disorder (MDD). A total of 33 articles were included (EMA = 26; EMI = 7). First, we provide a detailed analysis of the included studies from technical (sampling methods, duration, prompts), clinical (fields of application, adherence rates, dropouts, intervention effectiveness), and technological (adopted devices) perspectives. Then, we identify the advantages of using information and communications technologies (ICTs) to extend the potential of these approaches to the understanding, assessment, and intervention in depression. Furthermore, we point out the relevant issues that still need to be addressed within this field, and we discuss how EMA and EMI could benefit from the use of sensors and biosensors, along with recent advances in machine learning for affective modelling.},

  abstract = {Research on animal behavior is typically organized according to a combination of two influential frameworks: Ernst Mayr's distinction between proximate and ultimate causes, and Niko Tinbergen's ``four questions'' (mechanisms, development, survival value, and evolution). My aim is to debunk two common interpretive misconceptions about Mayr's proximate\textendash ultimate distinction and its relationship to Tinbergen's four questions, and to offer a new interpretation that avoids both. The first misconception is that the proximate\textendash ultimate distinction maps cleanly onto Tinbergen's four questions, marking a boundary between Tinbergen's evolutionary and survival value questions (ultimate) versus developmental and mechanistic questions (proximate). The second is that Mayr's proximate\textendash ultimate distinction is meant to rule out the relevance of proximate causes to evolutionary explanations. I argue that neither is plausible given the text and Mayr's philosophical aims, namely, to argue that evolutionary biology cannot be reduced to either the physical sciences or to other areas of biology. Through a reconstruction of Mayr's anti-reductionist argument, I develop an interpretation according to which the proximate\textendash ultimate distinction marks two ways that teleological reasoning can be naturalistically grounded in biology, corresponding to Mayr's distinction between teleonomic and adapted systems. Mayr distinguishes reduction, which the proximate\textendash ultimate distinction is meant to block, from analysis, through which he allows that proximate causes, causes that are neither proximate nor ultimate, and chance can all contribute to evolutionary explanations. I conclude by suggesting some ways in which the interpretation defended here reframes our understanding of Mayr's disagreements with some evolutionary-developmental biologists.},

  abstract = {Since the late 18th century, the Parthenon frieze has generally been viewed as a representation of the fifth-century Athenian citizenry participating in their annual (or quadrennial) Panathenaic procession. Viewed without a mythological reference, the frieze stands outside the conventions of Greek temple decoration, which regularly derived its subject matter from the mythical past. The story of King Erechtheus, his wife Praxithea, and their three maiden daughters who gave their lives to save Athens is proposed here as the mythological reference behind the images. The east frieze shows the royal family preparing for the sacrifice of the youngest daughter, required by an oracle for victory over Eumolpos. The assembly of gods looks out to the approaching sacrificial procession of the first commemorative festival, ordained by Athena, in memory of Erechtheus and the parthenoi. Erechtheus's triumphant cavalry and chariots follow behind those who bring animals to sacrifice, and those who carry water and honey offerings, all following behind the holy choruses of maidens who lead the procession. Thus, Athenians from the mythical past commemorate the dead hero and heroines and celebrate their first victory over outside aggressors in what may be viewed as a central aition of the Panathenaia itself.},

However, because mate selection is inherently multidimensional, a multivariate analysis more appropriately measures sex differences in mate preferences. We used the Mahalanobis distance (D) and logistic regression to investigate sex differences in mate preferences with data secured from participants residing in 37 cultures (n = 10,153). Sex differences are large in multivariate terms, yielding an overall D = 2.41, corresponding to overlap between the sexes of just 22.8\%. Moreover, knowledge of mate preferences alone affords correct classification of sex with 92.2\% accuracy. Finally, pattern-wise sex differences are negatively correlated with gender equality across cultures but are nonetheless cross-culturally robust. Discussion focuses on implications in evaluating the importance and magnitude of sex differences in mate preferences.},

How do people incorporate information on many different mate preferences in order to choose which partner to pursue? Here, in Study 1, we compare seven candidate algorithms for integrating multiple mate preferences in a competitive agent-based model of human mate choice evolution. This model shows that a Euclidean algorithm is the most evolvable solution to the problem of selecting fitness-beneficial mates. Next, across three studies of actual couples (Study 2: n = 214; Study 3: n = 259; Study 4: n = 294) we apply the Euclidean algorithm toward predicting mate preference fulfillment overall and preference fulfillment as a function of mate value. Consistent with the hypothesis that mate preferences are integrated according to a Euclidean algorithm, we find that actual mates lie close in multidimensional preference space to the preferences of their partners. Moreover, this Euclidean preference fulfillment is greater for people who are higher in mate value, highlighting theoretically-predictable individual differences in who gets what they want. These new Euclidean tools have important implications for understanding real-world dynamics of mate selection.},

In order for these ideal preferences to guide the choice of actual romantic partners, human mating psychology must possess a means to integrate information across these many preference dimensions into summaries of the overall mate value of their potential mates. Here we explore the computational design of this mate preference integration process using a large sample of n\,=\,14,487 people from 45 countries around the world. We combine this large cross-cultural sample with agent-based models to compare eight hypothesized models of human mating markets. Across cultures, people higher in mate value appear to experience greater power of choice on the mating market in that they set higher ideal standards, better fulfill their preferences in choice, and pair with higher mate value partners. Furthermore, we find that this cross-culturally universal pattern of mate choice is most consistent with a Euclidean model of mate preference integration.},

  abstract = {Objective To do a quantitative systematic review, including published and unpublished data, examining the associations between individual objective measures of physical capability (grip strength, walking speed, chair rising, and standing balance times) and mortality in community dwelling populations. Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data sources Relevant studies published by May 2009 identified through literature searches using Embase (from 1980) and Medline (from 1950) and manual searching of reference lists; unpublished results were obtained from study investigators. Study selection Eligible observational studies were those done in community dwelling people of any age that examined the association of at least one of the specified measures of physical capability (grip strength, walking speed, chair rises, or standing balance) with mortality. Data synthesis Effect estimates obtained were pooled by using random effects meta-analysis models with heterogeneity between studies investigated. Results Although heterogeneity was detected, consistent evidence was found of associations between all four measures of physical capability and mortality; those people who performed less well in these tests were found to be at higher risk of all cause mortality. For example, the summary hazard ratio for mortality comparing the weakest with the strongest quarter of grip strength (14 studies, 53 476 participants) was 1.67 (95\% confidence interval 1.45 to 1.93) after adjustment for age, sex, and body size (I2=84.0\%, 95\% confidence interval 74\% to 90\%; P from Q statistic {$<$}0.001). The summary hazard ratio for mortality comparing the slowest with the fastest quarter of walking speed (five studies, 14 692 participants) was 2.87 (2.22 to 3.72) (I2=25.2\%, 0\% to 70\%; P=0.25) after similar adjustments. Whereas studies of the associations of walking speed, chair rising, and standing balance with mortality have only been done in older populations (average age over 70 years), the association of grip strength with mortality was also found in younger populations (five studies had an average age under 60 years). Conclusions Objective measures of physical capability are predictors of all cause mortality in older community dwelling populations. Such measures may therefore provide useful tools for identifying older people at higher risk of death.},

  abstract = {Suicide is one of the most devastating aspects of human nature and has puzzled scholars for thousands of years. Most suicide research to date has focused on establishing the prevalence and predictors of the presence or severity of suicidal thoughts/behaviors. Surprisingly little research has documented the fundamental properties of suicidal thoughts/behaviors, such as: when someone has a suicidal thought, how long do such thoughts last? Documenting the basic properties of a phenomenon is necessary to understand, study, and treat it. This study aims to identify the timescale of suicidal thinking, leveraging novel real-time monitoring data and a number of different novel analytic approaches. Participants were 105 adults with past week suicidal thoughts who completed a 42-day real-time monitoring study (total number of observations=20,255). Participants completed two forms of real time assessments: traditional real-time assessments (spaced hours apart each day) and high-frequency assessments (spaced 10 minutes apart over one hour). We found that suicidal thinking changes rapidly. Both descriptive statistics and Markov-Switching models indicated that that elevated states of suicidal thinking lasted on average 1 to 3 hours. Individuals exhibited considerable heterogeneity in how often and for how long they reported elevated suicidal thinking, and our analyses suggest that different aspects of suicidal thinking operated on different timescales. Continuous-time autoregressive models suggest that current suicidal intent is predictive of future intent levels for 2 to 3 hours, while current suicidal desire predictive of future suicidal desire levels for 20 hours. Multiple models found that elevated suicidal intent has on average shorter duration than elevated suicidal desire. Finally, our ability to capture within-person dynamics of suicidal thinking was improved using high-frequency sampling. For example, traditional real-time assessments alone estimated the duration of severe suicidal states of suicidal desire as 9.5 hours, whereas, the high-frequency assessments shifted the estimated duration to 1.4 hours. The high-frequency assessments identified 19\% more participants with a high-risk response than the traditional real-time assessment, and high frequency measurements were shown to capture considerable levels of variation across consecutive measurement occasions. These results provide the most detailed characterization to date of the temporal dynamics of suicidal thinking. Furthermore, these findings highlight the importance of sampling frequency in capturing the dynamics of a phenomenon.},

However, conceptualisations of ``impulsivity'' are inconsistent and ambiguities exist regarding which facets of impulsivity are actually involved in the canalisation of reproductive strategies. Two variables commonly used to represent impulsivity were examined in relation to reproductive behaviour. Results demonstrated that sensation seeking was significantly related to strategy-based behaviour, but impulsivity (defined as a failure to deliberate) was only weakly correlated. The effect of impulsivity disappeared when sensation seeking was controlled. Sex differences emerged for sensation seeking but not impulsivity. We conclude that ``impulsivity'' is not a unitary trait and that clearer distinctions should be made between facets of this construct.},

  abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system, affecting an estimated 2 million people worldwide, and is the second cause of neurological disability in young adults after traumatic brain injuries. Although the aetiology remains unknown, several lines of evidence support autoimmunity as playing a major role in disease development. MS incidence has significantly increased during the second half of the twentieth century. This has been attributed to changes in certain environmental factors, including a significant decline in exposure to infections, due to better public health practices. Epidemiological studies suggest autoimmune diseases, such as MS, are less frequent in individuals infected by certain kinds of parasites, particularly those called helminths. This observation has been tested in different autoimmune disease animal models in which mice colonized with helminths show protection from disease. Downmodulation of inflammatory responses resulting from helminth infection has sparked interest in exploring the potential clinical efficacy of establishing controlled infections in patients suffering from autoimmune diseases, using live parasitic worms, in an attempt to decrease disease severity. To date, clinical trials using helminth therapy in MS have been safety-oriented and small in size, seeking to reproduce and confirm epidemiological and experimental data. Clearly, longer studies, monitoring safety and objective outcome measures are necessary to assess this novel therapeutic strategy. Alternatively, identification of helminth-derived immunomodulatory molecules mimicking the protective effects of parasite infections might also help combat autoimmune diseases without undesired side effects.},

Indicators were defined for birth occurring at 34 to 36 6/7 weeks' gestation (late preterm), 32 to 33 6/7 weeks' gestation, 28 to 31 6/7 weeks' gestation, and less than 28 weeks' gestation (very preterm birth). Ten secondary outcomes were examined including small for gestational age, placental abruption, transfer to neonatal intensive care, and 5-minute Apgar score. Coarsened exact matching techniques and Poisson regression models were used to estimate the risk difference (RD) and relative risk (RR) of outcomes associated with cannabis exposure and control for confounding.In a cohort of 661\,617 women, the mean gestational age was 39.3 weeks and 51\% of infants were male. Mothers had a mean age of 30.4 years and 9427 (1.4\%) reported cannabis use during pregnancy. Imbalance in measured maternal obstetrical and sociodemographic characteristics between reported cannabis users and nonusers was attenuated using matching, yielding a sample of 5639 reported users and 92\,873 nonusers. The crude rate of preterm birth less than 37 weeks' gestation was 6.1\% among women who did not report cannabis use and 12.0\% among those reporting use in the unmatched cohort (RD, 5.88\% [95\% CI, 5.22\%-6.54\%]). In the matched cohort, reported cannabis exposure was significantly associated with an RD of 2.98\% (95\% CI, 2.63\%-3.34\%) and an RR of 1.41 (95\% CI, 1.36-1.47) for preterm birth. Compared with no reported use, cannabis exposure was significantly associated with greater frequency of small for gestational age (third percentile, 6.1\% vs 4.0\%; RR, 1.53 [95\% CI, 1.45-1.61]), placental abruption (1.6\% vs 0.9\%; RR, 1.72 [95\% CI, 1.54-1.92]), transfer to neonatal intensive care (19.3\% vs 13.8\%; RR, 1.40 [95\% CI, 1.36-1.44]), and 5-minute Apgar score less than 4 (1.1\% vs 0.9\%; RR, 1.28 [95\% CI, 1.13-1.45]).Among pregnant women in Ontario, Canada, reported cannabis use was significantly associated with an increased risk of preterm birth. Findings may be limited by residual confounding.},

  abstract = {Objective Metacognitive methodologies are used to examine the integrity of self-referential processing in healthy adults, and have been implemented to study disorders of the self-concept in neurologic and psychiatric populations. However, the extent to which metacognitive evaluations assess a uniquely self-evaluative capacity that cannot be explained fully by primary cognitive functions, demographics, or mood is not clear. The objective of the current study was to examine whether metamemory and a metacognitive test of agency shared a self-referential association that would not be explained by cognition, demographics, or mood. Methods 38 non-demented older adults (MMSE {$>$}=24 and mean age = 68.13) participated in metacognitive testing and completed cognitive testing and mood questionnaires. Bivariate correlations were used to evaluate the association between metamemory and agency, and to determine the cognitive (memory, attention, and executive functioning), demographic (age and education), and mood (anxiety and depression) correlates of each. Correlates of metamemory and agency were then entered into linear regression models to determine whether any association between metacognitive measures remained. Results Metamemory was associated with agency judgments (n = 27), specifically those on self-controlled rather than computer-controlled trials (r = .41, p = .03). Regression results supported a role for agency in predicting metamemory, above and beyond memory and education ({$\beta$} = .39, p = .034). Metamemory was also an independent predictor of agency judgments ({$\beta$} = .36, p = .049). Conclusions The interrelation between metamemory and agency judgments suggests that metacognitive testing captures an important aspect of self-referential processing not otherwise assessed in a standard cognitive evaluation, and may provide unique information about self-evaluative capacities in clinical populations.},

Wakefield, 1999) is a useful concept, anchored in the recognition that the evolved human architecture consists of a collection of functional mechanisms that may potentially be impaired and whose impairment may be harmful. Because natural selection organized each mechanism to solve a distinct adaptive problem under ancestral conditions, the criteria for whether a mechanism is dysfunctional are supplied by whether the mechanism has become impaired in performing its ancestral function. Because evolutionary function and dysfunction diverge markedly from normal human standards of value, many dysfunctions are beneficial, whereas various mechanisms that are performing their evolved function may cause disturbing outcomes. For this reason, many conditions in addition to disorders may require treatment, and the authors attempt to sketch an evolutionary taxonomy of treatable conditions.},

Concrete evidence linking social context to specific facial expressions is sparse and is largely based on survey-based approaches, which are often constrained by language and small sample sizes7\textendash 13. Here, by applying machine-learning methods to real-world, dynamic behaviour, we ascertain whether naturalistic social contexts (for example, weddings or sporting competitions) are associated with specific facial expressions14 across different cultures. In two experiments using deep neural networks, we examined the extent to which 16 types of facial expression occurred systematically in thousands of contexts in 6~million videos from 144 countries. We found that each kind of facial expression had distinct associations with a set of contexts that were 70\% preserved across 12~world regions. Consistent with these associations, regions varied in how frequently different facial expressions were produced as a function of which contexts were most salient. Our results reveal fine-grained patterns in human facial expressions that are preserved across the modern world.},

Chi-square tests were used to compare characteristics and counseling for postpartum marijuana use. For participants with postpartum use, adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) were calculated to evaluate relationships between safety perceptions and breastfeeding initiation and duration.ResultsOverall, 5.5\% (95\% CI [4.6, 6.6]) of participants reported postpartum marijuana use; among these women, 47.2\% (CI [37.6, 56.9]) were breastfeeding at the time of the survey. Overall, 25.7\% of participants indicated that they had been advised, by their prenatal care provider, against marijuana use while breastfeeding. Breastfeeding initiation or duration did not differ by postpartum marijuana use. Among participants with postpartum use, those who perceived marijuana was safe for breastfeeding women to use were more likely to have breastfed (aPR = 1.22, CI [1.04, 1.43]) and have a breastfeeding duration {$>$} 12 weeks (aPR = 1.57, CI [1.08, 2.27]) compared to those who perceived it to be unsafe.ConclusionsUnderstanding maternal safety beliefs and provider education about the latest evidence and guidance related to postpartum marijuana use may improve clinical care.},

Each of 45 normal female undergraduates conversed on the telephone with either a depressed patient ( n = 15), a nondepressed patient ( n = 15), or a normal control ( n = 15). It was found that following the phone conversation, Ss who had spoken to depressed patients were themselves significantly more depressed, anxious, hostile, and rejecting. Measures of activity, approval responses, hope statements, and genuineness did not distinguish between S groups or between target groups, but important differences were found in the Ss' perception of the patients. It was proposed that environmental response may play an important role in the maintenance of depressed behavior. Furthermore, special skills may be required of the depressed person to cope with the environment his behavior creates. (21 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Socially constructed masculine ideals dictate that men be stoic in the aftermath of loss, most often expressing their sadness and despair as anger. Perhaps because of alignment to such masculine ideals little research has been done to explore young men's grief \textendash{} and chronicle the ways they think about loss, their responses and how they go about describing their identities after a tragic event. Using qualitative individual interviews and photo elicitation methods, we investigated the ways in which 25 men aged 19\textendash 25 grieved the accidental death of a male friend. The study was conducted from April 2010\textendash December 2011. Causes of death were diverse, and included motor vehicle accidents, adventure sports, drug overdose and fights. The findings revealed men's predominant grief responses as emptiness, anger, stoicism and sentimentality. Participants' description of their grief responses illustrated the ways in which they struggled to reconcile feelings of vulnerability and manly ideals of strength and stoicism. We gained insight into men's grief practices by looking at the ways in which they aligned themselves with a post-loss masculine identity. These identities, which included the adventurer, father-figure and the lamplighter, revealed gender-specific processes through which men understood and actively dealt with their tragic loss. The results offer novel insights to men's grief and identity work that may serve to affirm other men's experiences as well as guide counselling services targeted to young men.},

Evolutionary considerations are useful in this context because they direct us to the identification of specific human adaptations that become dysregulated in disease, though either underdevelopment or overdevelopment. Autism is thus conceptualized in terms of underdeveloped social cognition, such that the highly elaborated human social brain does not complete its usual developmental trajectory. Psychotic affective conditions, mainly schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression, are, in contrast to autism, conceptualized in terms of dysfunctionally overdeveloped aspects of social cognition, such that they are caused by opposite neural system alterations to those producing autism. The hypothesis that autism and psychotic affective conditions represent diametric disorders is supported by a wide range of convergent evidence from genetics, development, neuroscience, psychology, and cognitive science. The diametric model provides for reciprocal illumination of the causes of these conditions and makes specific recommendations for research strategies and the development of novel treatments.},

Methods Data come from the 2016 Health and Retirement Study (HRS) DBS laboratory reports and the HRS merged with the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) Global Historical Climate Network Daily (NCDC GHCN-Daily) and the NCDC Local Climatological Data, by zip code. We ran regression models to examine the associations between assay values based on DBS for five analytes (total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), C-reactive protein (CRP), and cystatin C) and the characteristics of DBS cards and drops, shipping time, and temperature, and humidity at the time of collection. Results We found cholesterol measures to be sensitive to many factors including small spots, shipping time, high temperature and humidity. Small spots in DBS cards are related to lower values across all analytes. Longer DBS transit time before freezing is associated with lower values of total and HDL cholesterol and cystatin C. Results were similar whether or not venous blood sample values were included in equations. Conclusions Small spots, long shipping time, and exposure to high temperature and humidity need to be avoided if possible. Quality of spots and cards and information on shipping time and conditions should be coded with the data to make adjustments in values when necessary. The different results across analytes indicate that results cannot be generalized to all DBS assays.},

Endocannabinoids that activate CB1R are abundant in the early postnatal brain and in mother's milk, but few studies have investigated their function in newborns. We examined postnatal CB1R expression in the major striatonigral circuit from striosomes of the striatum to the dopamine-containing neurons of the substantia nigra. CB1R enrichment was first detectable between postnatal day (P)5 and P7, and this timing coincided with the formation of "striosome-dendron bouquets," the elaborate anatomic structures by which striosomal neurons control dopaminergic cell activity through inhibitory synapses. In Cnr1-/- knock-out mice lacking CB1R expression, striosome-dendron bouquets were markedly disorganized by P11 and at adulthood, suggesting a postnatal pathfinding connectivity function for CB1R in connecting striosomal axons and dopaminergic neurons analogous to CB1R's prenatal function in other brain regions. Our finding that CB1R plays a major role in postnatal wiring of the striatonigral dopamine-control system, with lasting consequences at least in mice, points to a crucial need to determine whether lactating mothers' use of CB1R agonists (e.g., in marijuana) or antagonists (e.g., type 2 diabetes therapies) can disrupt brain development in nursing offspring.},

  abstract = {This volume presents state-of-the-art empirical studies working in a paradigm that has become known as human behavioral ecology. The emergence of this approach in anthropology was marked by publication by Aldine in 1979 of an earlier collection of studies edited by Chagnon and Irons entitled Evolutionary Biology and Human Social Behavior: An Anthropological Perspective. During the two decades that have passed since then, this innovative approach has matured and expanded into new areas that are explored here.The book opens with an introductory chapter by Chagnon and Irons tracing the origins of human behavioral ecology and its subsequent development. Subsequent chapters, written by both younger scholars and established researchers, cover a wide range of societies and topics organ-ized into six sections. The first section includes two chapters that provide historical background on the development of human behavioral ecology and com-pare it to two complementary approaches in the study of evolution and human behavior, evolutionary psychology, and dual inheritance theory. The second section includes five studies of mating efforts in a variety of societies from South America and Africa. The third section covers parenting, with five studies on soci-eties from Africa, Asia, and North America. The fourth section breaks somewhat with the tradition in human behavioral ecology by focusing on one particularly problematic issue, the demographic transition, using data from Europe, North America, and Asia. The fifth section includes studies of cooperation and helping behaviors, using data from societies in Micronesia and South America. The sixth and final section consists of a single chapter that places the volume in a broader critical and comparative context. The contributions to this volume demonstrate, with a high degree of theoretical and methodological sophistication--the maturity and freshness of this new paradigm in the study of human behavior. The volume will be of interest to anthropologists and other professions working on the study of cross-cultural human behavior. Lee Cronk is associate professor of anthropology at Rutgers University. Napoleon Chagnon is professor of anthropology, emeritus at the University of California, Santa Barbara. William Irons is professor of anthropology at Northwestern University, Evanston Illinois.},

  abstract = {Objectives To evaluate state-level prevalence estimates of prenatal and early postnatal cannabis use in a state with legalized medical and recreational marijuana and the association with adverse neonatal outcomes. Study design We conducted a cross-sectional study on 3,207 respondents from the 2014-2015 Colorado Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System with state-developed questions on cannabis use. Differences in perinatal cannabis use were evaluated according to maternal characteristics, breastfeeding patterns, and pregnancy intendedness. Multiple logistic regression models evaluated the relationship between prenatal cannabis use and adverse neonatal outcomes including low birth weight, small for gestational age, preterm birth, and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. Results The self-reported prevalence of cannabis use at any time during pregnancy was 5.7\,{$\pm$}\,0.5\% and the prevalence of early postnatal cannabis use among women who breastfed was 5.0\% (95\% CI, 4.1\%-6.2\%). Prenatal cannabis use was associated with a 50\% increased likelihood of low birth weight, independent of maternal age, race/ethnicity, level of education, and tobacco use during pregnancy (OR,\,1.5; 95\% CI, 1.1-2.1; P\,=\,.02). Small for gestational age, preterm birth, and neonatal intensive care unit admission were not associated with prenatal cannabis use, independent of prenatal tobacco use. Conclusions Our findings underscore the importance of screening for cannabis use during prenatal care and the need for provider counselling about the adverse health consequences of continued use during pregnancy and lactation.},

  abstract = {Background: Although most studies examining the relationship between depression and mortality indicate that there is excess mortality in depressed subjects, this is not confirmed in all studies. Furthermore, it has been hypothesized that mortality rates in depressed men are higher than in depressed women. Finally, it is not clear if the increased mortality rates exist only in major depression or also in subclinical depression. Methods: A meta-analysis was conducted to examine these questions. A total of 25 studies with 106,628 subjects, of whom 6416 were depressed, were examined. Both univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted. Results: The overall relative risk (RR) of dying in depressed subjects was 1.81 (95\% CI: 1.58\textendash 2.07) compared to non-depressed subjects. No major differences were found between men and women, although the RR was somewhat larger in men. The RR in subclinical depression was no smaller than the RR in clinical depression. Limitations: Only RRs of mortality were examined, which were not corrected for important confounding variables, such as chronic illnesses, or life-style. In the selected studies important differences existed between study characteristics and populations. The number of comparisons was relatively small. Conclusions: There is an increased risk of mortality in depression. An important finding of this study is that the increased risk not only exists in major depression, but also in subclinical forms of depression. In many cases, depression should be considered as a life-threatening disorder.},

  abstract = {Background: Legalization and decriminalization of marijuana has been associated with increased use in women of child-bearing age. Since tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) has been shown to pass into breast milk, concern exists not only for the effects of prenatal exposure, but also for post-natal exposure via mother's milk (MM). Our neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) allows provision of MM for early preterm infants regardless of THC status, though many will restrict MM use in this scenario given concerns about effects on the neonate. Our objective was to evaluate differences in outcomes between neonates who did vs. did not have exposure to THC prenatally and postnatally via MM. Methods: Retrospective medical record review of early preterm (\&lt;34 weeks gestational age, GA) neonates born 9/2014-12/2020 and admitted to our Level IV NICU. Our institution conducts universal urine toxicology and substance use screens on mothers admitted to labor and delivery. We compared maternal and neonatal characteristics in four cohorts: 1) THC positive moms providing MM, 2) THC positive moms who provided no MM, 3) THC negative moms who provided MM, 4) THC negative moms who provided no MM. We performed multivariable analyses to assess the effect of THC and MM status on significant outcomes. Results: We identified 763 early preterm neonates, of whom 59\% (n=448) were non-Hispanic Black and 31\% (n=233) were non-Hispanic White. Seventeen percent (n=130) of mothers tested positive for THC. Mothers positive for THC were more likely to be late to prenatal care (PNC) while those who did not provide MM were more likely to receive no PNC (p\&lt;0.0001). There were no significant differences between the 4 cohorts in regards to growth restriction, oxygen requirement at 36weeks, necrotizing enterocolitis, ventilator requirement, and tracheostomy requirement. However, we did find increased incidence of all grade intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) in those infants who were THC exposed (p=0.0015), though the largest incidence overall and specifically of grade III/IV IVH was in THC exposed infants without MM. We therefore performed logistic regression for predictors of IVH in early preterms and found that when controlling for variables such as birth weight, neither THC status (p=0.18) nor MM status (p=0.79) significantly predicted IVH in early preterms. The only significant predictors were antenatal steroids, delivery mode, and birth GA. Conclusion: Providing MM from THC positive women to early preterm neonates is controversial as the longer term effects of this exposure are unknown. In our study, we found no evidence that providing MM from THC positive mothers was detrimental to the health of this early preterm population through hospital discharge. A better understanding of longer term perinatal outcomes associated with THC exposure both in-utero and postnatally via MM would inform appropriate interventions to improve clinical outcomes and safely encourage MM provision for early preterm infants.}

Method A sample of 2,062 cannabis users completed the DFAQ-CU and was used to assess the DFAQ-CU's factor structure and reliability. To assess validity, a subsample of 645 participants completed additional measures of cannabis dependence and problems (Marijuana Smoking History Questionnaire [MSHQ], Timeline Followback [TLFB], Cannabis Abuse Screening Test [CAST], Cannabis Use Disorders Identification Test Revised [CUDIT-R], Cannabis Use Problems Identification Test [CUPIT], and Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test [AUDIT]). Results A six-factor structure was revealed, with factors measuring: daily sessions, frequency, age of onset, marijuana quantity, cannabis concentrate quantity, and edibles quantity. The factors were reliable, with Cronbach's alpha coefficients ranging from .69 (daily sessions) to .95 (frequency). Results further provided evidence for the factors' convergent (MSHQ, TLFB), predictive (CAST, CUDIT-R, CUPIT), and discriminant validity (AUDIT). Conclusions The DFAQ-CU is the first psychometrically sound inventory for measuring frequency, age of onset, and quantity of cannabis use. It contains pictures of marijuana to facilitate the measurement of quantity of marijuana used, as well as questions to assess the use of different forms of cannabis (e.g., concentrates, edibles), methods of administering cannabis (e.g.,},

The public avidly consumes accounts of real-life homicide cases, and murder fiction is more popular still. Nevertheless, we have only the most rudimentary scientific understanding of who is likely to kill whom and why. Martin Daly and Margo Wilson apply contemporary evolutionary theory to analysis of human motives and perceptions of self-interest, considering where and why individual interests conflict, using well-documented murder cases. This book attempts to understand normal social motives in murder as products of the process of evolution by natural selection. They note that the implications for psychology are many and profound, touching on such matters as parental affection and rejection, sibling rivalry, sex differences in interests and inclinations, social comparison and achievement motives, our sense of justice, lifespan developmental changes in attitudes, and the phenomenology of the self. This is the first volume of its kind to analyze homicides in the light of a theory of interpersonal conflict. Before this study, no one had compared an observed distribution of victim-killer relationships to \&quot;expected\&quot; distribution, nor asked about the patterns of killer-victim age disparities in familial killings. This evolutionary psychological approach affords a deeper view and understanding of homicidal violence.},

The first is one of distributive justice: how will the (presumed) efficiency gains from automated labour be distributed through society? The second is one of personal fulfillment and meaning: if people no longer have to work, what will they do with their lives? In this article, I set aside the first issue and focus on the second. In doing so, I make three arguments. First, I argue that there are good reasons to embrace non-work and that these reasons become more compelling in an era of technological unemployment. Second, I argue that the technological advances that make widespread technological unemployment possible could still threaten or undermine human flourishing and meaning, especially if (as is to be expected) they do not remain confined to the economic sphere. And third, I argue that this threat could be contained if we adopt an integrative approach to our relationship with technology. In advancing these arguments, I draw on three distinct literatures: (1) the literature on technological unemployment and workplace automation; (2) the antiwork critique\textemdash which I argue gives reasons to embrace technological unemployment; and (3) the philosophical debate about the conditions for meaning in life\textemdash which I argue gives reasons for concern.},

To address this question, we studied a unique cohort of 1,196 children with both objective, court-documented evidence of maltreatment and subjective reports of their childhood maltreatment histories made once they reached adulthood, along with extensive psychiatric assessment. We found that, even for severe cases of childhood maltreatment identified through court records, risk of psychopathology linked to objective measures was minimal in the absence of subjective reports. In contrast, risk of psychopathology linked to subjective reports of childhood maltreatment was high, whether or not the reports were consistent with objective measures. These findings have important implications for how we study the mechanisms through which child maltreatment affects mental health and how we prevent or treat maltreatment-related psychopathology. Interventions for psychopathology associated with childhood maltreatment can benefit from deeper understanding of the subjective experience.},

The most prevalent cardiovascular forms of diseases can be linked to adaptive selective forces acting during the evolution of cardiovascular systems from invertebrate animals to mammals, i.e., for 4 billion years, that have become maladaptive during the post-agricultural period, in humans following the changes in civilization, environment, and habits. Key among these is the association of arterial hypertension with increased dietary salt intake. Atherosclerotic disease has also been linked to meat and fat consumption. Policies to treat CD must be twofold: (1) to remove the maladaptive changes, e.g., high dietary salt, obesity, and high cholesterol and (2) to use our understanding of the molecular aspects of CD to develop targeted therapeutics, e.g., diuretics to increase salt excretion and to reduce lipids.},

Indigenous communities have long experienced oppression by Western researchers. Is it possible to build a collaborative research knowledge that is culturally appropriate, respectful, honoring, and careful of the Indigenous community? What are the challenges in Western research, researchers, and Western university methodology research training? How have `studies' \textendash{} critical anti-racist theory and practice, cross-cultural research methodology, critical perspectives on environmental justice, and land-based education \textendash{} been incorporated into the university to disallow dissent? What can be done against this disallowance? According to Eve Tuck and K Wayne Yang's (2012) suggestion, this article did not use the concept of decolonization as a substitute for `human rights' or `social justice', but as a demand of an Indigenous framework and a centering of Indigenous land, Indigenous sovereignty and Indigenous ways of thinking. This article discusses why both research and researcher increasingly require decolonization so that research can create a positive impact on the participants' community, and conduct research ethically. This article is my personal decolonization and reclaiming story from 15 years of teaching, research and service activities with various Indigenous communities in various parts of the world. It presents a number of case studies of an intervention research project to exemplify the challenges in Western research training, and how decolonizing research training attempts to not only reclaim participants' rights in the research but also to empower the researcher. I conclude by arguing that decolonizing research training creates more empathetic educators and researchers, transforming us for participants, and demonstrating how we can take responsibility for our research.},

Die drei griechischen Gesandten, Menelaos, Odysseus und der Herold Talthybios, sitzen links auf Stufen, wo sie von Theano, der Priesterin der Athena, und ihren Gef\"ahrtinnen begr\"usst werden. Eine imposante Kavalkade von f\"unfzehn Reitern und zwei Kriegern zu Fuss begleitet die vier Frauen. Die Steinstufen, auf denen die Griechen sitzen, sind von Sir John Beazley, als er vor zwanzig Jahren die Vase ver\"offentlichte, f\"ur die Treppe an der Innenseite der Stadtmauer gehalten worden. Nach eingehender Untersuchung der fr\"uhen noch erhaltenen literarischen Zeugnisse wird man hier aber zum Schluss gef\"uhrt, die griechischen Gesandten seien als Schutzflehende auf den Stufen eines monumentalen Treppenaltars dargestellt. Die Lage der Szene im Heiligtum der Athena wird auch durch die Spindel und den Spinnrocken der Theano angedeutet, die an ihre Schenkung eines pr\"achtigen Tuches im Tempel dieser G\"ottin des Spinnens erinnern (Ilias 6,297-311). Wenn die Griechen vorher wahrscheinlich von einer Gottheit (Athena?) mit Nebel umh\"ullt worden sind, um das Heiligtum direkt und ohne Gefahr zu erreichen, warten sie jetzt als Schutzflehende sichtbar auf dem Altar. Hier werden sie von Theano vielleicht im Laufe eines Festzuges entdeckt. Nachdem die Priesterin die Gesandtschaft wohlwollend empfangen hat, werden sie von ihrem Mann Antenor gastlich empfangen, um sp\"ater ihre Forderungen vor den Trojanern stellen zu d\"urfen. Diese Deutung des Bildes wird von einem fragmentarischen Dithyrambos des Bakchylides (15 Maehler) gest\"utzt. Die gemeinsame Quelle f\"ur Vasenmaler und Dichter m\"ogen die Kyprien gewesen sein, wie es schon Beazley vorgeschlagen hat. Nach dieser Auffassung des Mythos spielt Theano eine Hauptrolle wie andere huldreiche Frauen in der griechischen Sage, die griechische Heroen oft aus der Not gerettet haben (vgl. Lukian, Imagines 19).},

  abstract = {Over the past two decades, developing countries have recognized the economic value of attractive marine resources and the need to actively protect these resources. Many of these conservation projects rely on limiting extractive activities to protect habitats, which restricts local livelihoods, and promoting marine resource-based tourism to provide financing for conservation. Using a political ecology framework, this dissertation investigates two connected aspects of tourism and conservation: tourists' seafood consumption and the Go Blue Central America, a geotourism project initiated by National Geographic. It also explains the value of considering the local environmental knowledge of a diverse group of resource users, with a specific focus on professional scuba divers. Given the importance of scuba diving as an activity and tourism attractor on Utila, professional scuba divers on the island are well-positioned to serve as a source of environmental knowledge data on Utila's dive sites, including on their condition, species sightings, and changes over time. This knowledge is not without its problems as it may lead to conceptions of local participation that fail to include those actually from the community of concern. Thus, this dissertation calls attention to the possibilities of using divers' environmental knowledge in conservation and environmental management while also remaining attuned to the potential complications that may arise from doing so. Ultimately, this dissertation calls for the development of additional tourism alternatives and more comprehensive tourism planning and management which includes the potential for damage done by nonextractive resource users. For Utila, this will entail altering existing business practices to increase local ownership, shifting away from backpacker and budget oriented tourism toward a more expensive product, and involving more of the local community in the decision-making processes which affect tourism and the environment.},

Obesity in pregnancy is known to increase one's risk of experiencing poor maternal mental health and associated physical and mental health complications. Probiotics may represent a novel approach to intervene in poor mental health and obesity. We conducted this pre-specified secondary analysis of the Healthy Mums and Babies (HUMBA) randomised controlled trial to investigate whether probiotics would improve maternal mental health outcomes up to 36 weeks of pregnancy. Two-hundred-and-thirty pregnant women with obesity (BMI\,{$\geq$}\,30.0\,kg/m2) were recruited and randomised to receive probiotic (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Bifidobacterium lactis BB12, minimum 6.5\,\texttimes\,109 CFU) or placebo capsules. Depression, anxiety, and functional health and well-being were assessed at baseline (120-176 weeks' gestation) and 36 weeks of pregnancy. Depression scores remained stable and did not differ between the probiotic (M\,=\,7.18, SD\,=\,3.80) and placebo groups (M\,=\,6.76, SD\,=\,4.65) at 36 weeks (p-values\,{$>$}\,0.05).

  abstract = {Capturing a scientific change in thinking about personality and individual differences that has been building over the past 15 years, this volume stands at an important moment in the development of psychology as a discipline. Rather than viewing individual differences as merely the raw material upon which selection operates, the contributing authors provide theories and empirical evidence which suggest that personality and individual differences are central to evolved psychological mechanisms and behavioral functioning. The book draws theoretical inspiration from life history theory, evolutionary genetics, molecular genetics, developmental psychology, personality psychology, and evolutionary psychology, while utilizing the theories of the "best and the brightest" international scientists working on this cutting edge paradigm shift. In the first of three sections, the authors analyze personality and the adaptive landscape; here, the authors offer a novel conceptual framework for examining "personality assessment adaptations." Because individuals in a social environment have momentous consequences for creating and solving adaptive problems, humans have evolved "difference-detecting mechanisms" designed to make crucial social decisions such as mate selection, friend selection, kin investment, coalition formation, and hierarchy negotiation. In the second section, the authors examine developmental and life-history theoretical perspectives to explore the origins and development of personality over the lifespan. The third section focuses on the relatively new field of evolutionary genetics and explores which of the major evolutionary forces--such as balancing selection, mutation, co-evolutionary arms races, and drift--are responsible for the origins of personality and individual differences. Existing as a seminal work in the newly emerging evolutionary psychology field, this book is a "must-read" for anyone invested in the development of psychology as a field.},

While many interesting proposals are competing for attention in the literature, they tend to focus narrowly on the proximate level of analysis and lack a broader understanding of biological function. In this paper, we present an integrative framework for mental disorders built on concepts from life history theory, and describe a taxonomy of mental disorders based on its principles, the Fast-Slow-Defense model (FSD). The FSD integrates psychopathology with normative individual differences in personality and behavior, and allows researchers to draw principled distinctions between broad clusters of disorders, as well as identify functional subtypes within current diagnostic categories. Simulation work demonstrates that the model can explain the large-scale structure of comorbidity, including the apparent emergence of a general ``p factor'' of psychopathology.

  abstract = {We aimed to describe the prevalence of intimate partner violence (IPV) during pregnancy across 19 countries, and examine trends across age groups and UN regions. We conducted a secondary analysis of data from the Demographic and Health Surveys (20 surveys from 15 countries) and the International Violence Against Women Surveys (4 surveys from 4 countries) carried out between 1998 and 2007. Our data suggest that intimate partner violence during a pregnancy is a common experience. The prevalence of IPV during pregnancy ranged from approximately 2.0\% in Australia, Cambodia, Denmark and the Philippines to 13.5\% in Uganda among ever-pregnant, ever-partnered women; half of the surveys estimated prevalence to be between 3.9 and 8.7\%. Prevalence appeared to be higher in African and Latin American countries relative to the European and Asian countries surveyed. In most settings, prevalence was relatively constant in the younger age groups (age 15\textendash 35), and then appeared to decline very slightly after age 35. Intimate partner violence during pregnancy is more common than some maternal health conditions routinely screened for in antenatal care. Global initiatives to reduce maternal mortality and improve maternal health must devote increased attention to violence against women, particularly violence during pregnancy.R\'esum\'eNous souhaitions d\'ecrire la pr\'evalence de la violence exerc\'ee sur les femmes enceintes par un partenaire intime dans 19 pays, et examiner les tendances par groupes d'\^age et r\'egions des Nations Unies. Nous avons men\'e une analyse secondaire des donn\'ees d'enqu\^etes d\'emographiques et sanitaires (20 enqu\^etes dans 15 pays) et d'enqu\^etes internationales sur la violence faite aux femmes (quatre enqu\^etes dans quatre pays) r\'ealis\'ees entre 1998 et 2007. Nos donn\'ees indiquent que la violence du partenaire intime pendant la grossesse est fr\'equente. Sa pr\'evalence allait d'environ 2,0\% en Australie, au Cambodge, au Danemark et aux Philippines \`a 13,5\% en Ouganda parmi les femmes ayant d\'ej\`a \'et\'e enceintes et ayant d\'ej\`a eu un partenaire ; la moiti\'e des enqu\^etes estimaient cette pr\'evalence entre 3,9 et 8,7\%. La pr\'evalence semblait plus \'elev\'ee dans les pays d'Afrique et d'Am\'erique latine que dans les pays d'Europe et d'Asie ayant fait l'objet des enqu\^etes. Dans la plupart des pays, la pr\'evalence \'etait relativement constante dans les groupes d'\^age les plus jeunes (15\textendash 35 ans) et semblait d\'ecliner tr\`es l\'eg\`erement apr\`es 35 ans. La violence du partenaire intime pendant la grossesse est plus fr\'equente que certaines conditions de sant\'e maternelle qui font l'objet d'un d\'epistage syst\'ematique dans les consultations pr\'enatales. Les initiatives mondiales pour r\'eduire la mortalit\'e maternelle et am\'eliorer la sant\'e maternelle doivent consacrer davantage d'attention \`a la violence faite aux femmes, en particulier pendant la grossesse.ResumenNos propusimos describir la prevalencia de violencia de pareja \'intima (VPI) durante el embarazo en 19 pa\'ises y examinar las tendencias en diferentes grupos etarios y regiones de la ONU.

Nuestros datos indican que la violencia de pareja \'intima durante el embarazo es una experiencia com\'un. La prevalencia de la VPI durante el embarazo vari\'o de un 2.0\% en Australia, Camboya, Dinamarca y Filipinas al 13.5\% en Uganda entre mujeres alguna vez embarazadas, que alguna vez tuvieron pareja; la mitad de las encuestas calcularon una prevalencia del 3.9\% al 8.7\%. La prevalencia pareci\'o ser m\'as alta en pa\'ises africanos y latinoamericanos comparada con los pa\'ises europeos y asi\'aticos encuestados. En la mayor\'ia de los entornos, la prevalencia era relativamente constante en los grupos m\'as j\'ovenes (de 15 a 35 a\~nos) y pareci\'o disminuir muy poco despu\'es de los 35 a\~nos de edad.

  abstract = {Suicidal behaviours are one of the most important contributors to the global burden of disease among women, but little is known about prevalence and modifiable risk factors in low and middle income countries. We use data from the WHO multi-country study on women's health and domestic violence against women to examine the prevalence of suicidal thoughts and attempts, and relationships between suicide attempts and mental health status, child sexual abuse, partner violence and other variables. Population representative cross-sectional household surveys were conducted from 2000\textendash 2003 in 13 provincial (more rural) and city (urban) sites in Brazil, Ethiopia, Japan, Namibia, Peru, Samoa, Serbia, Thailand and Tanzania. 20967 women aged 15\textendash 49 years participated. Prevalence of lifetime suicide attempts, lifetime suicidal thoughts, and suicidal thoughts in the past four weeks were calculated, and multivariate logistic regression models were fit to examine factors associated with suicide attempts in each site. Prevalence of lifetime suicide attempts ranged from 0.8\% (Tanzania) to 12.0\% (Peru city); lifetime thoughts of suicide from 7.2\% (Tanzania province) to 29.0\% (Peru province), and thoughts in the past four weeks from 1.9\% (Serbia) to 13.6\% (Peru province). 25\textendash 50\% of women with suicidal thoughts in the past four weeks had also visited a health worker in that time. The most consistent risk factors for suicide attempts after adjusting for probable common mental health disorders were: intimate partner violence, non-partner physical violence, ever being divorced, separated or widowed, childhood sexual abuse and having a mother who had experienced intimate partner violence. Mental health policies and services must recognise the consistent relationship between violence and suicidality in women in low and middle income countries. Training health sector workers to recognize and respond to the consequences of violence may substantially reduce the health burden associated with suicidal behaviour.},

  abstract = {Questions surrounding the chronology, place, and character of the initial human colonization of the Americas are a long-standing focus of debate. Interdisciplinary debate continues over the timing of entry, the rapidity and direction of dispersion, the variety of human responses to diverse habitats, the criteria for evaluating the validity of early sites, and the differences and similarities between colonization in North and South America. Despite recent advances in our understanding of these issues, archaeology still faces challenges in defining interdisciplinary research problems, assessing the reliability of the data, and applying new interpretative models. As the debates and challenges continue, new studies take place and previous research reexamined. Here we discuss recent exploratory excavation at and interdisciplinary data from the Monte Verde area in Chile to further our understanding of the first peopling of the Americas. New evidence of stone artifacts, faunal remains, and burned areas suggests discrete horizons of ephemeral human activity in a sandur plain setting radiocarbon and luminescence dated between at least \textasciitilde 18,500 and 14,500 cal BP. Based on multiple lines of evidence, including sedimentary proxies and artifact analysis, we present the probable anthropogenic origins and wider implications of this evidence. In a non-glacial cold climate environment of the south-central Andes, which is challenging for human occupation and for the preservation of hunter-gatherer sites, these horizons provide insight into an earlier context of late Pleistocene human behavior in northern Patagonia.},

The 75 papers included in this review cover both original research studies and those which undertook secondary analyses of primary data sources. The reviewed research papers published from 2006 to 2012 include quantitative and qualitative studies from Western and developing countries. The results show that while there is variation in prevalence of IPV across various cultural settings, IPV was associated with a range of mental health issues including depression, PTSD, anxiety, self-harm, and sleep disorders. In most studies, these effects were observed using validated measurement tools. IPV was also found to be associated with poor physical health including poor functional health, somatic disorders, chronic disorders and chronic pain, gynaecological problems, and increased risk of STIs. An increased risk of HIV was reported to be associated with a history of sexual abuse and violence. The implications of the study findings in relation to methodological issues, clinical significance, and future research direction are discussed.},

Setting Rehabilitation hospital. Participants White women (N=123 of 149) who were consecutively admitted to a rehabilitation hospital because of their first fracture of the hip. Interventions Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures We measured appendicular lean mass (aLM) by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) 21.1{$\pm$}8.7 (mean {$\pm$} SD) days after hip fracture occurrence in the 123 women. On the same day, we assessed grip strength at the nondominant arm with a dynamometer. At the end of acute inpatient rehabilitation we measured the ability to function in activities of daily living by using the Barthel Index, and lower limb performance by using the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test. Results We found significant correlations between handgrip strength measured before rehabilitation and Barthel Index scores after rehabilitation ({$\rho$}=.50; P{$<$}.001), Barthel Index effectiveness ({$\rho$}=.45; P{$<$}.001), and the TUG test ({$\rho$}=-.41; P{$<$}.001). Conversely, we found no significant correlations between aLM/height2 and Barthel Index scores after rehabilitation ({$\rho$}=.075; P=.41), Barthel Index effectiveness ({$\rho$}=.06; P=.53), or the TUG test ({$\rho$}=.005; P=.96). Significant associations between grip strength and all the outcome measures persisted after adjustment for 8 potential confounders, including Barthel Index scores before rehabilitation, age, number of medications, number of comorbidities, pressure ulcers, concomitant infections, time between fracture occurrence and assessment, and aLM/height2. Conclusions Grip strength, but not DXA-assessed aLM, significantly predicted short-term functional outcome in women after a hip fracture.},

  abstract = {Judging physical attractiveness involves sight, touch, sound and smells. Where visual judgments are concerned, attentional processes may have evolved to prioritize sex-typical traits that reflect cues signaling direct or indirect (i.e. genetic) benefits. Behavioral techniques that measure response times or eye movements provide a powerful test of this assumption by directly assessing how attractiveness influences the deployment of attention. We used eye-tracking to characterize women's visual attention to men's back-posed bodies, which varied in overall fat and muscle distribution, while they judged the potential of each model for a shortor long-term relationship. We hypothesized that when judging male bodily attractiveness women would focus more on the upper body musculature of all somatotypes, as it is a signal of metabolic health, immunocompetence and underlying endocrine function. Results showed that mesomorphs (muscular men) received the highest attractiveness ratings, followed by ectomorphs (lean men) and endomorphs (heavily-set men). For eye movements, attention was evenly distributed to the upper and lower back of both ectomorphs and mesomorphs. In contrast, for endomorphs the lower back, including the waist, captured more attention over the viewing period. These patterns in visual attention were evident in the first second of viewing, suggesting that body composition is identified early in viewing and guides attention to body regions that provide salient biological information during judgments of men's bodily attractiveness.},

  abstract = {Although research on paternal postpartum depression (PPD) is relatively scarce, two recent meta-analytic reviews have identified maternal PPD as the strongest predictor of paternal PPD. Despite the association between maternal and paternal PPD, no research currently exists exploring how maternal influences paternal PPD. Based on a family systems framework and the relationship enhancement model, we proposed decreased spousal support and relationship satisfaction would explain the association between maternal and paternal PPD. Using data gathered at 1 and 9 months postpartum from 92 couples making the transition to parenthood, we found maternal and paternal PPD are indirectly linked through the pathways of impaired spousal support and reduced relationship satisfaction. This study provides evidence into the importance of spousal relationship functioning to paternal mental health during the postpartum period.

  abstract = {The evolutionary basis for clinical depression is not well understood. A growing body of literature that is not based on evolutionary logic links inflammation to depression. Integration of these findings with an evolutionary framework for depression, however, needs to address the reasons why the body's inflammatory response would be regulated so poorly that it would result in incapacitating depression. Pathogen induction of inflammation offers an explanation, but the extent to which the association between inflammation and depression can be attributed to general inflammation as opposed to particular effects of proinflammatory pathogens remains unclear. This paper reports a study of sexually transmitted pathogens, which addresses this issue. Although several sexually transmitted pathogens were associated with depression according to bivariate tests, only Chlamydia trachomatis and Trichomonas vaginalis were significantly associated with depression by a multivariate analysis that accounted for correlations among the pathogens. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that infection may contribute to depression through induction of tryptophan restriction, and a consequent depletion of serotonin. It reinforces the idea that some depression may be caused by specific pathogens in specific evolutionary arms races with their human host.},

Cultural consonance is the degree to which individuals, in their own beliefs and behaviors, approximate shared cultural models. A measure of cultural consonance in social support, based on a cultural consensus analysis regarding sources and patterns of social support in Brazil, was developed. In a survey of 258 persons, the association of cultural consonance in social support and C-reactive protein was examined, controlling for age, sex, body mass index, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, depressive symptoms, and a social network index. Lower cultural consonance in social support was associated with higher C-reactive protein. Implications of these results for future research are discussed.},

The article also evaluates the energetics of human and primate gestation and lactation using data from a variety of different populations living under different environmental circumstances. Energetics refers to energy intake and expenditure, and changes in body fat stores. Human and nonhuman primates have longer periods of gestation and lactation and slower prenatal and postnatal growth than other mammals of similar size. This reduces daily maternal energy costs. The development of sizable fat stores is not unique to humans, but fat stores are typically greater in human females and may play a greater role in reproduction. The strategies used to meet the energy costs of pregnancy vary among populations of humans and nonhuman primates and among humans interindividual variability is high. In pregnancy, some increase energy intake but others apparently do not. Increases in metabolic efficiency are evident in some human populations, whereas decreases in physical activity occur, but are not seen in all human or primate populations. Lactation is more energetically costly on a daily basis among humans and nonhuman primates, but has not been as well studied. It appears that both nonhuman and human primates tend to increase energy intake to meet in part the cost of lactation. They also use other strategies such as relying on body tissue stores, reductions in physical activity, and/or increases in metabolic efficiency to meet the remainder of the cost. It is also clear that human females in different populations and different women in the same population use a different combination of strategies to meet the cost of lactation.}

  abstract = {Multiple sources of evidence support a role for diminished dopaminergic neurotransmission in major depression. The physiological alterations underlying reduced dopamine (DA) signaling could result from either diminished DA release from presynaptic neurons or impaired signal transduction, either due to changes in receptor number or function and/or altered intracellular signal processing. There are data supporting each of these mechanisms, although interpretation of previous research is confounded by issues around study population, medication status, and technological limitations. In some patients with depression, DA-related disturbances improve by treatment with antidepressants, presumably by acting on serotonergic or noradrenergic circuits, which then affect DA function. However, most antidepressant treatments do not directly enhance DA neurotransmission, which may contribute to residual symptoms, including impaired motivation, concentration, and pleasure. Animal models of major depression show considerable responsiveness to manipulations of DA neurotransmission. Several studies, including postmortem investigations, particularly of subjects with severe depression, have demonstrated reduced concentrations of DA metabolites both in the cerebrospinal fluid and in brain regions that mediate mood and motivation. Although the neuroimaging findings are not unequivocal, several studies support the hypothesis that major depression is associated with a state of reduced DA transmission, possibly reflected by a compensatory up-regulation of D2 receptors. These alterations in DA signaling may underlie the findings of increased ``liking'' or ``high'' feelings reported by severely depressed subjects treated with d-amphetamine compared with the response of less severely ill and normal control subjects. The efficacy of medications that directly act on DA neurons or receptors, such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors and pramipexole, suggests that subtypes of depression stemming from a primary DA dysfunction exist. Further research on the contribution of DA to the pathophysiology of depression is justified to improve outcomes for patients with treatment-resistant and nonremitting depression.}

Greater estrogen produced by ovaries causes bones in female bodies to fuse before males' resulting in sex differences in adult height and mass. Female pelves expand more than males' due to estrogen and relaxin produced and employed by the tissues of the pelvic region and potentially also due to greater internal space occupied by female gonads and genitals. Evolutionary explanations for skeletal sex differences (aka sexual dimorphism) that focus too narrowly on big competitive men and broad birthing women must account for the adaptive biology of skeletal growth and its dependence on the developmental physiology of reproduction. In this case, dichotomizing evolution into proximate-ultimate categories may be impeding the progress of human evolutionary science, as well as enabling the popular misunderstanding and abuse of it.},

  abstract = {Major depressive disorder (MDD) presents with a variety of symptoms and responds to a wide range of treatment interventions. Diagnostic criteria collapse multiple syndromes with distinct etiologies into the same disorder. MDD is typically understood as a malfunction of neurotransmission or brain circuitry regulating mood, pleasure and reward, or executive function. However, research from an evolutionary perspective suggests that the ``normal'' functioning of adaptations may also generate symptoms meeting diagnostic criteria. Functioning adaptations may be an underappreciated etiological pathway to MDD. Many adaptive functions for depressive symptoms have been suggested: biasing cognition to avoid losses, conserving energy, disengaging from unobtainable goals, signaling submission, soliciting resources, and promoting analytical thinking. We review the potential role of these adaptive functions and how they can lead to specific clusters of depressive symptoms. Understanding MDD from such a perspective reduces the heterogeneity of cases and may help to select the best intervention for each patient. We discuss the implications of different adaptive and maladaptive etiological pathways for the use of antidepressants and various modes of psychotherapy. In particular, instances of MDD caused by functioning adaptations may benefit most from treatments that support the adaptive function, or that target the precipitating causal stressor. We conclude that an evolutionary approach to the study of MDD may be one of the more promising approaches to reduce its heterogeneity and to better match patients and treatment.},

In contrast, women's fWHR was reliably negatively associated with raters' judgments of how dominant, trustworthy, sociable, emotionally stable, responsible, confident, attractive, and intelligent women appeared, and positively associated with how weird women appeared. Because these findings do not follow from assumptions and theory guiding fWHR research, the underlying theoretical framework may need revising.},

Over 40years of research on its impact has suggested that SA has particularly severe effects on a variety of forms of psychopathology, and has highlighted unique aspects of SA as a form of trauma that contribute to these outcomes. The goal of this meta-analytic review was to synthesize the empirical literature from 1970 to 2014 (reflecting 497 effect sizes) to understand the degree to which (a) SA confers general risk for psychological dysfunction rather than specific risk for posttraumatic stress, and (b) differences in studies and samples account for variation in observed effects. Results indicate that people who have been sexually assaulted report significantly worse psychopathology than unassaulted comparisons (average Hedges' g=0.61). SA was associated with increased risk for all forms of psychopathology assessed, and relatively stronger associations were observed for posttraumatic stress and suicidality. Effects endured across differences in sample demographics. The use of broader SA operationalizations (e.g., including incapacitated, coerced, or nonpenetrative SA) was not associated with differences in effects, although including attempted SA in operationalizations resulted in lower effects. Larger effects were observed in samples with more assaults involving stranger perpetrators, weapons, or physical injury. In the context of the broader literature, our findings provide evidence that experiencing SA is major risk factor for multiple forms of psychological dysfunction across populations and assault types.},

Examples were endemic fecal\textendash oral infections by viral, bacterial, or protozoic pathogens, such as hepatitis A virus, Helicobacter pylori, or Toxoplasma gondii. Later, this concept also included microorganisms beyond pathogens, such as commensals and symbionts, and the hygiene hypothesis was extended to inflammatory diseases in general. An impressive illustration of the hygiene hypothesis was found in the consistent farm effect on asthma and allergies, which has partly been attributed to immunomodulatory properties of endotoxin as emitted by livestock. Assessment of environmental microorganisms by molecular techniques suggested an additional protective effect of microbial diversity on asthma beyond atopy. Whether microbial diversity stands for a higher probability to encounter protective clusters of microorganisms or whether it is a proxy of a balanced environmental exposure remains elusive. Diversity of the mucosal microbiome of the upper airways probably reflects an undisturbed balance of beneficial microorganisms and pathogens, such as Moraxella catarrhalis, which has been associated with subsequent development of asthma and pneumonia. In addition, specific fermenters of plant fibers, such as the genera Ruminococcus and Bacteroides, have been implied in asthma protection through production of short-chain fatty acids, volatile substances with the capability to reduce T-helper cell type 2\textendash mediated allergic airway inflammation. Evolutionary thinking may offer a key to understanding noncommunicable inflammatory diseases as delayed adaptation to a world of fast and profound environmental changes. Better adaptation may be fostered by growing insight into the interplay between man and microbiome and an adequate choice of the environmental exposure.},

  abstract = {Depression represents a global mental health concern, and disproportionally affects women as they are twice more likely to be diagnosed than men. In this review, we provide a summary of evidence to support the notion that differences in depression between men and women span multiple facets of the disease, including epidemiology, symptomology, treatment, and pathophysiology. Through a lens of biological sex, we overview depression-related transcriptional patterns, changes in neuroanatomy and neuroplasticity, and immune signatures. We acknowledge the unique physiological and behavioral demands of pregnancy and motherhood by devoting special attention to depression occurring in the peripartum period. Specifically, we discuss issues surrounding the presentation, time course, treatment, and neurobiology of peripartum depression. We write this review with the intention of highlighting the encouraging advancements in our understanding of sex differences in depression, while underscoring the gaps that remain. A more systematic consideration of biological sex as a variable in depression research will be critical in the discovery and development of pharmacotherapies that are efficacious for both men and women.},

The current research provides a longitudinal test of this theory. Assessments of family environments, based on interviews with mothers and fathers, were conducted in preschool, and children were then followed prospectively through middle childhood. Adrenal hormones were assayed in a selected subsample of 120 children (73 girls) at age 7, and parent and child reports of secondary sexual characteristics were collected in the full female sample of 180 girls at age 11. Higher quality parental investment (from both mothers and fathers) and less father-reported Marital Conflict/Depression forecast later adrenarche. Older age at menarche in mothers, higher socioeconomic status, greater mother-based Parental Supportiveness, and lower third-grade body mass index each uniquely and significantly predicted later sexual development in daughters. Consistent with a life history perspective, quality of parental investment emerged as a central feature of the proximal family environment in relation to pubertal timing.},

We then address the evolution of individual differences in susceptibility to the environment, which engenders systematic person\textendash environment interactions in the effects of stress on development. Finally, we discuss stress-mediated regulation of pubertal development as a case study of how an evolutionary\textendash developmental approach can foster theoretical integration.},

  abstract = {In this article, a collaborative effort between archaeologists and marine ecologists, we discuss the role kelp forest ecosystems may have played in facilitating the movement of maritime peoples from Asia to the Americas near the end of the Pleistocene. Growing in cool nearshore waters along rocky coastlines, kelp forests offer some of the most productive habitats on earth, with high primary productivity, magnified secondary productivity, and three-dimensional habitat supporting a diverse array of marine organisms. Today, extensive kelp forests are found around the North Pacific from Japan to Baja California. After a break in the tropics\textemdash where nearshore mangrove forests and coral reefs are highly productive\textemdash kelp forests are also found along the Andean Coast of South America. These Pacific Rim kelp forests support or shelter a wealth of shellfish, fish, marine mammals, seabirds, and seaweeds, resources heavily used historically by coastal peoples. By about 16,000 years ago, the North Pacific Coast offered a linear migration route, essentially unobstructed and entirely at sea level, from northeast Asia into the Americas. Recent reconstructions suggest that rising sea levels early in the postglacial created a highly convoluted and island-rich coast along Beringia's southern shore, conditions highly favorable to maritime hunter-gatherers. Along with the terrestrial resources available in adjacent landscapes, kelp forests and other nearshore habitats sheltered similar suites of food resources that required minimal adaptive adjustments for migrating coastal peoples. With reduced wave energy, holdfasts for boats, and productive fishing, these linear kelp forest ecosystems may have provided a kind of ``kelp highway'' for early maritime peoples colonizing the New World.},

An evolutionary perspective provides a framework for such assessments because evolutionary selection acts on cells during the process of oncogenesis, on individuals to generate protection against oncogenesis, and on pathogens in ways that compromise mechanisms of protection. By distinguishing barriers to oncogenesis from restraints, essential causes can be distinguished from exacerbating causes, and the relative importance of interfering with genetic, environmental, and infectious causes can be assessed. The relevance of this framework is illustrated by evidence derived from populations in Utah that differ in their exposure to risk factors, particularly sexually transmitted pathogens and tobacco smoke. These considerations and assessment of the evidence for infectious causation of cancers lead to the conclusion that greater effort needs to be made to identify and prevent infectious causes of cancer, particularly infectious agents transmitted in sexual partnerships and by contaminated needles.},

Unlike other creatures, people frequently cooperate with genetically unrelated strangers, often in large groups, with people they will never meet again, and when reputation gains are small or absent. These patterns of cooperation cannot be explained by the nepotistic motives associated with the evolutionary theory of kin selection and the selfish motives associated with signalling theory or the theory of reciprocal altruism. Here we show experimentally that the altruistic punishment of defectors is a key motive for the explanation of cooperation. Altruistic punishment means that individuals punish, although the punishment is costly for them and yields no material gain. We show that cooperation flourishes if altruistic punishment is possible, and breaks down if it is ruled out. The evidence indicates that negative emotions towards defectors are the proximate mechanism behind altruistic punishment. These results suggest that future study of the evolution of human cooperation should include a strong focus on explaining altruistic punishment.},

  abstract = {In his description of the boat race in the fifth book of the "Aeneid", Vergil's comparison of the ships to chariots can be read not only as an allusion to the Homeric model on which the scene is based but also as part of a larger attempt to recast the episode as a contemporary circus spectacle. Like the Augustan circus, Vergil's boat race offers an image of cosmic and political order. However, beyond its symbolic function the Roman circus also played an active role in realizing the hierarchies it depicted by incorporating its spectators into a unified vision of state and universe. So the boat race too, far from constituting a hiatus in the action of the poem, becomes an instrument for the socialization of those who watch it. The spectacle gives its audience a glimpse of the gods in action and of the leadership of Aeneas himself, whose past accomplishments are reflected in the conduct of the captains. Moreover, the careful organization of internal audiences within the narrative allows every spectator to identify with another figure closer to the center of events and, by extension, invites Vergil's own readers to see themselves as participants in the scene. Thus Vergil uses the model of circus spectacle to bridge the gap separating his audience from the epic past by restaging that past in a form that both was a part of the immediate experience of the contemporary Roman and also provided a crucial context for the constitution of Roman civic life.},

In Experiment 1 participants studied face\textendash name and face\textendash occupation pairs assigned 1 or 10 points, made judgements of learning, and were given a cued recall test. High-value names were recalled more often than low-value names. However, recall of occupations was not influenced by value. In Experiment 2 meaningless nonwords were used for both names and occupations. The name difficulty disappeared, and value influenced recall of both names and occupations. Thus value similarly influenced names and occupations when meaningfulness was held constant. In Experiment 3 participants were required to use overt rote rehearsal for all items. Value did not boost recall of high-value names, suggesting that differential processing could not be implemented to improve memory. Thus incentives may improve memory for proper names by motivating people to engage in selective rehearsal and effortful elaborative processing.},

To some extent, mild AD-like changes arise at later ages in primate species with widely differing life spans from lines that diverged 50 or more million years ago. We discuss the changing role of host defense in modern human populations that are under greatly reduced natural selection from infectious agents.},

Handgrip strength correlated negatively with neuroticism and positively with extraversion in men, and negatively with agreeableness in women.

We hypothesized that women in traditional relationship contexts would express their anger less directly, and would suppress their anger more, due to expected negative social appraisals. We compared anger reactions to a conflict situation in a traditional and egalitarian relationship context. Eighty-two Dutch adult participants (43 women and 39 men) were recruited partly by students in a psychology class, and partly by a snowball method. They were invited to participate only if they had a steady relationship of minimally one year. The results show that women report more intense subjective anger in both contexts, but that the expression of anger differed with relationship context. In traditional relationships women tend to suppress their anger more than men, while men report to express their anger directly more than women. This difference in anger expression was mediated by negative social appraisals. In egalitarian relationships, this difference was not found.},

In this review, we discuss the recent literature regarding ``omics'' technologies and growth factors (GF) in HC and the effects of pasteurization on its composition. Our aim was to provide new evidence in terms of transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and microbiomics, also in relation to maternal metabolic diseases and/or fetal anomalies and to underline the functions of GF. Since HC results are so precious, particularly for the vulnerable pre-terms category, we also discuss the importance of HM pasteurization to ensure donated HC even to neonates whose mothers are unable to provide. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review analyzing in detail the molecular pattern, microbiota, bioactive factors, and dynamic profile of HC, finding clinical correlations of such mediators with their possible in vivo effects and with the consequent impact on neonatal outcomes.},

To a large extent, handicap hypotheses have relied on energetic explanations for these costs. Here, we have presented a phenomenological model, operating on an intraspecific level, which views the cost of secondary sexual development from an endocrinological perspective. The primary androgenic hormone, testosterone, has a dualistic effect; it stimulates development of characteristics used in sexual selection while reducing immunocompetence. This "double-edged sword" creates a physiological trade-off that influences and is influenced by parasite burden. We propose a negative-feedback loop between signal intensity and parasite burden by suggesting that testosterone-dependent signal intensity is a plastic response. This response is modified in accordance with the competing demands of the potential costs of parasite infection versus that of increased reproductive success afforded by exaggerated signals. We clarify how this trade-off is intimately involved in the evolution of secondary sexual characteristics and how it may explain some of the equivocal empirical results that have surfaced in attempts to quantify parasite's effect on sexual selection.}

This repetition undermines what we can learn from studying individual diagnostic constructs because it can obscure both disorder- and symptom-specific signals. However, these lost opportunities are currently veiled because symptom repetition in the DSM-5 has not been quantified. This descriptive study mapped the repetition among the 1,419 symptoms described in 202 diagnoses of adult psychopathology in Section II of the DSM-5. Over a million possible symptom comparisons needed to be conducted, for which we used both qualitative content coding and natural language processing. In total, we identified 628 distinct symptoms: 397 symptoms (63.2\%) were unique to a single diagnosis, whereas 231 symptoms (36.8\%) repeated across multiple diagnoses a total of 1022 times (median 3 times per symptom; range 2-22). Some chapters had more repetition than others: For example, every symptom of every diagnosis in the Bipolar and Related Disorders chapter was repeated in other chapters, but there was no repetition for any symptoms of any diagnoses in the Elimination Disorders, Gender Dysphoria, or Paraphilic Disorders. The most frequently repeated symptoms included insomnia, difficulty concentrating, and irritability\textemdash listed in 22, 17, and 16 diagnoses, respectively. Notably, the top 15 most frequently repeating diagnostic criteria were dominated by symptoms of major depressive disorder. Overall, our findings lay the foundation for a better understanding of the extent and potential consequences of symptom overlap.},

  abstract = {Population ageing and the increase in age-related diseases are important issues for medicine and public health. A low-grade chronic pro-inflammatory status and a continuous/persistent antigenic load are a major characteristic of the ageing process called inflammaging and represent a mechanism at the basis of most age-related disorders. Thus, inflammation is a relevant target for treatment and medical intervention. In this chapter, we posit inflammaging within an evolutionary perspective to elucidate its biological complexity, i.e. the common evolutionary basis of stress response, inflammation and innate immunity, and to better understand population dynamics and individual lifelong trajectories. We will start with a brief description of human immunosenescence, antagonistic pleiotropy and the two-hits theory, as a background of the concept of healthy ageing. Then, the link between inflammaging and environment is illustrated by introducing the concept of immunological biography, in order to contextualize inflammaging within a lifelong human eco-anthropological perspective. This comprehensive approach includes the socio-cultural determinants as an essential component that plays a substantial role in triggering and maintaining the age-related inflammatory processes. In conclusion, the evolutionary perspective offers a unifying conceptual framework to better identify strategies able to decrease the rate of inflammaging starting from early life and with beneficial effects in old people. Dietary interventions are proposed as an example of an integrative approach capable of modulating inflammation and reducing the genetic risk of pathologies.},

Moreover, people from supportive environments, when exposed to harsh-unpredictable environmental cues, shift toward a present-orientation.

These assumptions shape prevailing ideas about the experiences that children are capable of adjusting to, and whether their responses are viewed as impairments or adaptations. Specifically, the expected childhood is often depicted as nurturing and safe, and characterized by high levels of caregiver investment. Here, we synthesize evidence from history, anthropology, and primatology to challenge this view. We integrate the findings of systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and cross-cultural investigations on three forms of threat (infanticide, violent conflict, and predation) and three forms of deprivation (social, cognitive, and nutritional) that children have faced throughout human evolution. Our results show that mean levels of threat and deprivation were higher than is typical in industrialized societies, and that our species has experienced much variation in the levels of these adversities across space and time. These conditions likely favored a high degree of phenotypic plasticity, or the ability to tailor development to different conditions. This body of evidence has implications for recognizing developmental adaptations to adversity, for cultural variation in responses to adverse experiences, and for definitions of adversity and deprivation as deviation from the expected human childhood.},

  abstract = {Major Depression (MD) is a highly heterogeneous diagnostic category. Diverse symptoms such as sad mood, anhedonia, and fatigue are routinely added to an unweighted sum-score, and cutoffs are used to distinguish between depressed participants and healthy controls. Researchers then investigate outcome variables like MD risk factors, biomarkers, and treatment response in such samples. These practices presuppose that (1) depression is a discrete condition, and that (2) symptoms are interchangeable indicators of this latent disorder. Here I review these two assumptions, elucidate their historical roots, show how deeply engrained they are in psychological and psychiatric research, and document that they contrast with evidence. Depression is not a consistent syndrome with clearly demarcated boundaries, and depression symptoms are not interchangeable indicators of an underlying disorder. Current research practices lump individuals with very different problems into one category, which has contributed to the remarkably slow progress in key research domains such as the development of efficacious antidepressants or the identification of biomarkers for depression. The recently proposed network framework offers an alternative to the problematic assumptions. MD is not understood as a distinct condition, but as heterogeneous symptom cluster that substantially overlaps with other syndromes such as anxiety disorders. MD is not framed as an underlying disease with a number of equivalent indicators, but as a network of symptoms that have direct causal influence on each other: insomnia can cause fatigue which then triggers concentration and psychomotor problems. This approach offers new opportunities for constructing an empirically based classification system and has broad implications for future research.},

Here, we review a host of studies documenting that specific depressive symptoms like sad mood, insomnia, concentration problems, and suicidal ideation are distinct phenomena that differ from each other in important dimensions such as underlying biology, impact on impairment, and risk factors. Furthermore, specific life events predict increases in particular depression symptoms, and there is evidence for direct causal links among symptoms. We suggest that the pervasive use of sum-scores to estimate depression severity has obfuscated crucial insights and contributed to the lack of progress in key research areas such as identifying biomarkers and more efficacious antidepressants. The analysis of individual symptoms and their causal associations offers a way forward. We offer specific suggestions with practical implications for future research.},

We review the many problems with depression measurement, including the limited evidence of validity and reliability. These issues raise grave concerns about common uses of depression measures, such as for diagnosis or tracking treatment progress. We argue that shortcomings arise because the measurement of depression rests on shaky methodological and theoretical foundations. Moving forward, we need to break with the field's tradition, which has, for decades, divorced theories about depression from how we measure it. Instead, we suggest that epistemic iteration, an iterative exchange between theory and measurement, provides a crucial avenue for progressing how we measure depression.},

These themes include the increasingly vague boundary between research and practice, unique harms to communities that are not addressed by the principle of respect for persons, and how growing complexity and commodification in research have shed light on the importance of transparency. The repercussions of Belmont's emphasis on the protection of vulnerable populations is also explored, as is the relationship between the report's ethical principles and their applications. It is concluded that while the Belmont Report was an impressive response to the ethical issues of its day, the field of research ethics involving human subjects may have outgrown it.},

The original aim was to examine whether providing environmental support at encoding would allow older adults to adjust their study time to the task difficulty by using effective encoding strategies. The difficulty of the learning task was manipulated by varying the strength of association of cue-target pairs (i.e., weak vs. strong associates). This allowed us to measure metacognitive control in aging and, specifically, the ability to adjust study time according to task difficulty. The level of environmental support at encoding was manipulated to examine whether it could be used by older adults to adjust their study time according to the task difficulty. In contrast to the classical literature on the effect of aging on metacognitive control, we found that older adults were able to adjust their study time to task difficulty when environmental support was provided. Furthermore, providing encoding strategies with information about their effectiveness helped older adults adjust their study time to task difficulty optimally by improving their strategy use and compensating for their associative memory deficit.

Yet, sexual selection in females is still considered a peculiarity, and the evolution of polyandry is often viewed to result from a higher mating interest of males. Here, we present meta-analytic evidence from 77 species across a broad range of animal taxa to demonstrate that female reproductive success is overall positively correlated with mating success, suggesting that females typically benefit from multiple mating. Importantly, we found that these fitness gains likely promote the evolution of polyandry. Our findings offer support for the idea that sexual selection is widespread in females and to play a key role for the evolution of animal mating systems. Thereby, our results extend our understanding of the evolutionary consequences of sexual reproduction and contribute to a more balanced view of how sexual selection operates in males and females.},

Random intercept cross-lagged panel analyses supported the between-persons differences only model, controlling for sociodemographic variables, within-time covariances between construct residuals, and autoregressive stabilities: Individuals who were higher on expressed anger tended to be higher on depressive symptoms and, within individuals, neither fluctuations in anger nor depression appeared to influence the other across intervals ranging from one year to 18 years. Although social support did not mediate an anger\textendash{} depression connection, intraindividual increases in expressed anger predicted future intraindividual increases in perceived support (i.e., age 18 anger to age 19 support, and age 20 anger to age 22 support). A similar path from age 19 depressive symptoms to age 20 perceived support was observed. There were also some gender differences in the paths. The results point to stable interindividual differences in negative emotionality in place by age 18 and maintained up to age 43.},

  abstract = {Why is life paced so differently across as well as within organisms? Can one expect across-species patterns to be repeated within a species too, among individuals? The answer to these questions requires understanding conditions under which reaction norms evolve. We provide an overview of what we believe to be understudied areas of life-history theory, to foster theoretical work and to help deriving predictions for the evolution of human reaction norms. We discuss both why one might expect reaction norms to be aligned with patterns across species, and why that expectation might sometimes fail. It is not impossible for environmental cues to shape life histories in the current generation, but compared with cue-independent genetic adaptation, the adaptive task is now more complex; cues may be inaccurate or change in value with time; and parental strategies may differ between situations where offspring have the possibility to disperse to new habitats and situations where environmental conditions remain the same across generations. In that regard, we comment on the value of source-sink theory and on the importance of being specific about the way density regulation affects individual vital rates. We also remind the reader that adaptation does not necessarily optimize population growth rates when conflict between entities (e.g. between the two sexes) is a feature in the adaptive process, or when the same gene cannot produce an optimal phenotype in different entities (e.g. in females and males). All these factors likely play an important role on the evolution of reaction norms, and we argue in favour of their more systematic inclusion in human life-history research.},

With the onset of 100,000year Middle Pleistocene glacial cycles (``ice ages'') some 780,000years ago, large-bodied Homo groups had reached modern size and had successfully dispersed from equatorial Africa, Central, and Southeast Asia to high-latitude localities in Atlantic Europe and North East Asia. While there is support for incursions of multiple Homo lineages to West Asia and Continental Europe at this time, data does not favour a persistence of Homo erectus beyond {$\sim$}400,000years ago in Africa, west and Central Asia, and Europe. Novel Middle Pleistocene Homo forms (780,000\textendash 400,000years) may not have been substantially taller (150\textendash 170cm) than earlier Homo (1.6Ma\textendash 800,000years), yet brain size exceeded 1000cm3 and body mass approached 80kg in some males. Later Pleistocene Homo (400,000\textendash 138,000years) were `massive' in their height (160\textendash 190cm) and mass (70\textendash 90kg) and consistently exceed recent humans. Relative brain size exceeds earlier Homo, yet is substantially lower than in final glacial H. sapiens and Homo neanderthalensis. A final leap in absolute and relative brain size in Homo (300,000\textendash 138,000years) occurred independent of any observed increase in body mass and implies a different selective mediator to that operating on brain size increases observed in earlier Homo.},

Bottle feeding also undermines natural hormonal changes triggered by breastfeeding that function to promote birth spacing. Increases in the risk of autism and other complications in children conceived within a year or two of their next oldest sibling may occur as a consequence. By sidestepping important features of the birthing process, Caesarean sections likewise appear to impair optimal breastfeeding outcomes and often lead to related problems. We identify a number of other medical and childcare practices surrounding birth and the early post-natal period that could also benefit from an evolutionary perspective.},

The fact that HGS represents such a ubiquitous measure of health and vitality may reflect the significance of this trait during human evolution. This trait is also highly sexually dimorphic due to influences of androgenic hormones and fat-free body mass, suggesting that it has been further elaborated through sexual selection. Consistent with this view, research within evolutionary psychology and related fields has documented distinct relationships between HGS and measures of social and sexual behavior, especially in men. Here, we review studies across different societies and cultural contexts showing that male HGS predicts measures of aggression and social dominance, perceived formidability, male-typical body morphology and movement, courtship display, physical attractiveness, and sexual behavior and reproductive fitness. These findings underscore the value of including HGS as an independent measure within studies examining human sexual selection, and corroborate existing research suggesting that specific features of physical strength have and continue to be under positive directional selection in men.},

  abstract = {Background: Depressive symptoms differ from each other in the degree of functional impairment they cause. The incidence of depression varies across the adult lifespan. We examined whether age moderates the impairment caused by depressive symptoms. Methods: The study sample (n = 21,056) was adults drawn from six multistage probability samples from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey series (NHANES, years 2005\textendash 2016) conducted in the United States using cross-sectional, representative cohorts. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). We used regression models to predict high functional impairment, while controlling for sociodemographic variables and physical disorders. Results: Age moderated the association between depressive symptoms and functional impairment: middle-aged adults perceived moderate and severe symptoms as more impairing than did others. Older adults reported slightly higher impairment due to mild symptoms. The individual symptoms of low mood, feelings of worthlessness and guilt, and concentration difficulties were more strongly related to high impairment in mid-adulthood as compared to early and late adulthood. Limitations: Cross-sectional data allows only between-person comparisons. The PHQ-9 is brief and joins compound symptoms into single items. There was no information available concerning comorbid mental disorders. Co-occurring physical disorders were self-reported. Conclusions: Symptoms of depression may imply varying levels of impairment at different ages. The results suggest a need for age adjustments when estimating the functional impact of depression in the general population. Additionally, they show a need for more accurate assessments of depression-related impairment at older ages. Evidence-based programs may generally benefit from symptom- and age-specific findings.},

  abstract = {Background Altered hypothalamic\textendash pituitary\textendash adrenal (HPA) function and related changes in circulating glucocorticoids have been implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases that involve dysregulated immune function. Glucocorticoid hormones have both direct and indirect modulatory effects on both pro- and anti-inflammatory aspects of the immune system, including granulocytic and lymphocytic leukocyte subsets. However, past findings are complicated by inconsistencies across studies in how glucocorticoids and immune markers interact and relate to disease risk. Some incongruencies are likely due to an overreliance on single-unit (e.g., HPA or one immune marker) measures, and a failure to consider ecological exposures that may shape the base levels or correspondence between these systems. Here, we test single-unit and diurnal measures of HPA axis and immune system interactions in a less-industrial ecological setting with relatively high parasite loads. Methods In a sample of 114 Honduran women (mean age = 36 years), morning and evening blood samples were analyzed to quantify granulocytes, lymphocytes, and immunoglobulin-E (IgE). Saliva was collected over 2 days (8 samples per woman) to measure peak cortisol, cumulative cortisol, and slope of decline. These repeated measures of saliva and venous blood were used to investigate associations between single-point and diurnal salivary cortisol and leukocytes, under variable levels of past parasite exposure (proxied by IgE). Results Individuals with less of a decline in cortisol (i.e., ``flatter'' decline) show less of an increase in lymphocytes (2.27\% increase in cells/{$\mu$}L/hr; 95\% CI: 0.91\textendash 7.29; p = .01) across the day compared to those with steeper cortisol decline (7.5\% increase in lymphocytes; 95\% CI: 5.79\textendash 9.34; p {$<$} .001). IgE levels did not modify this association. Interestingly, IgE did moderate relationships between measures of cortisol and granulocytes: diurnal cortisol was positively associated with granulocytes, only in individuals with high previous exposure to parasites. There were no consistent relationships between single-unit measures of cortisol, lymphocytes or granulocytes, regardless of past parasite exposure. Discussion Results demonstrate that the relationship between HPA function and immune modulation cannot be fully understood without an understanding of local disease ecology. These results highlight the importance of research that seeks to identify etiologies of disease across environmental contexts.},

To characterize the links between stress and depression, the present study investigated whether neuroendoimmune activity mediates the relationship between perceived stress and depressive symptoms in 59 medically healthy adult females with varying levels of depression. Consistent with hypotheses, both greater perceived stress and higher concentrations of the proinflammatory immune marker, interleukin-6 (IL-6), were associated with greater depressive symptoms. Although neuroendoimmune activity did not significantly mediate the relationship between lifetime perceived stress and depressive symptoms, when considered together, elevated concentrations of IL-6 and lower free cortisol mediated the relationship between severity of childhood stress and current depressive symptoms. These findings shed light on how early life stress may be translated into adulthood depression.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Genome-wide sequencing of human populations has revealed substantial variation among genes in the intensity of purifying selection acting on damaging genetic variants. While genes under the strongest selective constraint are highly enriched for Mendelian disorders, most of these genes are not associated with disease and therefore the nature of the selection acting on them is not known. Here we show that genetic variants that damage these genes reduce reproductive success substantially in males but much less so in females. We present evidence that this reduction is mediated by cognitive and behavioural traits, which renders male carriers of such variants less likely to find mating partners. Our findings represent strong genetic evidence that Darwin9s theory of sexual selection is shaping the gene pool of contemporary human populations. Furthermore, our results suggest that sexual selection can account for about a quarter of all purifying selection acting on human genes.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {This study tested four theoretical models of leadership with data from the ethnographic record. The first was a game-theoretical model of leadership in collective actions, in which followers prefer and reward a leader who monitors and sanctions free-riders as group size increases. The second was the dominance model, in which dominant leaders threaten followers with physical or social harm. The third, the prestige model, suggests leaders with valued skills and expertise are chosen by followers who strive to emulate them. The fourth proposes that in small-scale, kin-based societies, men with high neural capital are best able to achieve and maintain positions of social influence (e.g., as headmen) and thereby often become polygynous and have more offspring than other men, which positively selects for greater neural capital. Using multiple search strategies we identified more than 1000 texts relevant to leadership in the Probability Sample of 60 cultures from the Human Relations Area Files (HRAF). We operationalized the model with variables and then coded all retrieved text records on the presence or absence of evidence for each of these 24 variables. We found mixed support for the collective action model, broad support for components of the prestige leadership style and the importance of neural capital and polygyny among leaders, but more limited support for the dominance leadership style. We found little evidence, however, of emulation of, or prestigebiased learning toward, leaders. We found that improving collective actions, having expertise, providing counsel, and being respected, having high neural capital, and being polygynous are common properties of leaders, which warrants a synthesis of the collective action, prestige, and neural capital and reproductive skew models. We sketch one such synthesis involving high-quality decision-making and other computational services.},

Frequent cannabis use results in higher delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in breast milk, and mode of cannabis use may also impact risk to the infant. The aim of this study was to understand how breastfeeding mothers use cannabis and factors related to frequency of its use. Methods: An anonymous online survey was conducted among mothers who used cannabis while breastfeeding. Frequency of cannabis use was ascertained along with modes of and reasons for cannabis use. Respondents were grouped by frequency of use: less-than-daily (n\,=\,686), low-daily (1\textendash 3 times/day; n\,=\,423), and high-daily ({$\geq$}4 times/day; n\,=\,218). Chi-square and analysis of variance tested between-group differences, and ordinal logistic regression examined factors associated with cannabis use frequency. Results: Smoking (88\%) was the most common mode of cannabis consumption, followed by vaping (48\%) and oral/edibles (36\%). Smoking and vaping differed by cannabis use frequency. Only 54\% used cannabis to get high, but was reported more among frequent users. In contrast, 89\% of mothers used cannabis for mental or physical health symptoms, including anxiety, depression, gastrointestinal symptoms, chronic pain, and posttraumatic stress disorder. These symptoms differed by cannabis use frequency. Reporting more symptoms was associated with higher frequency of use. The odds of increasing cannabis use frequency was 2.7 for those reporting 1\textendash 2 health reasons, 5.6 for those reporting 3\textendash 4 health reasons, and 13.1 for reporting {$\geq$}5 health reasons. Conclusions: Strategies are needed to address maternal mental and physical health, which may be key to reducing cannabis use among breastfeeding mothers.},

After further refining the aims of this chapter, within the second part I argue that also such relational approaches in evolutionary cognitive archaeology, which can be associated with the so-called ``conservative embodied and extended cognition'' movement, remain affected by deep philosophical problems. I contend that such a critique, although leaning toward the right direction of conceiving the mind as embodied and extended, remains bound to the internalist view it wishes to criticize. The third part of this chapter focuses upon building an alternative to the standard internalist view, which at the same time can eliminate the residual problems with the conservative embodied counterproposals. This implies drawing upon the recently emerging radical enactive and embodied account of cognition.},

The basic principle is that the preferred mate choices and attendant social cognitions and behaviors of both women and men, and those of other species, have evolved to focus on and exploit the reproductive potential and reproductive investment of members of the opposite sex. Reproductive potential is defined as the genetic, material, and/or social resources an individual can invest in offspring, and reproductive investment is the actual use of these resources to enhance the physical and social well-being of offspring. Similarities and differences in the mate preferences and choices of women and men are reviewed and can be understood in terms of similarities and differences in the form of reproductive potential that women and men have to offer and their tendency to use this potential for the well-being of children.},

One method often used to place input variables on a common scale is to divide each numeric variable by its standard deviation.

The resulting coefficients are then directly comparable for untransformed binary predictors. We have implemented the procedure as a function in R. We illustrate the method with two simple analyses that are typical of applied modeling: a linear regression of data from the National Election Study and a multilevel logistic regression of data on the prevalence of rodents in New York City apartments. We recommend our rescaling as a default option\textemdash an improvement upon the usual approach of including variables in whatever way they are coded in the data file\textemdash so that the magnitudes of coefficients can be directly compared as a matter of routine statistical practice.

Most studies have focused on a limited number of psychiatric disorders, and results have been inconsistent. The present report from the Rhode Island Methods to Improve Diagnostic Assessment and Services (MIDAS) project sought to replicate and extend prior findings examining which psychiatric disorders and demographic characteristics were independently associated with elevated levels of anger and aggression. Method 3800 individuals presenting to the Rhode Island Hospital Department of Psychiatry outpatient practice underwent a semi-structured interview to determine current Axis I (N=3800) and Axis II (N=2151) pathology. Severity of subjective anger and overt aggression within the past week were also assessed for each patient, and odds ratios were determined for each disorder. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to determine which diagnoses independently contributed to increased levels of anger and aggression. Results Almost half of the sample reported moderate-to-severe levels of current subjective anger, and more than 20\% endorsed moderate-to-severe levels of current overt aggression. The frequency of anger was similar to the frequencies of depressed mood and psychic anxiety. Anger and aggression were elevated across all diagnoses except adjustment disorder. Anger and aggression were most elevated in patients with major depressive disorder, panic disorder with agoraphobia, post-traumatic stress disorder, intermittent explosive disorder, and cluster B personality disorders. Conclusions Anger is as common as depressed mood and psychic anxiety amongst psychiatric outpatients, and problems with anger cut across diagnostic categories. Given the high prevalence of problems with anger in psychiatric patients, more research should be directed towards its effective treatment.},

In line with predictions from evolutionary theory, polygamy is beneficial to male reproductive success (i.e. producing larger numbers of surviving offspring). The success of polygamously married females depends on wife rank: the first wives of polygamous husbands do better than monogamously married women and much better than second or third wives. These effects are mirrored in child nutritional status: the children of second and third wives have lower weight for height. Due to potential, largely unmeasurable differences in marriageability (quality) between individuals, it was not possible to support a model of either resource-holding polygyny combined with female choice or female coercion into unwanted marriages. First wives of polygamously married men marry at a younger age and attract a higher brideprice, suggesting that both the males and females in the marriage are likely to be of higher quality (due to wealth, family status or some other factor such as beauty). Unions that end up monogamous are likely to be between slightly lower quality individuals; and second and third wives, who marry at the oldest ages and attract the lowest brideprice, may be `making the best of a bad job'. The relatively long gap between first and second marriages may mean that first wives of highly marriageable males can enjoy considerable reproductive success before their husbands marry again.},

Focusing on the key anthropological themes of reproduction, production, and distribution we highlight classic and recent research demonstrating the value of an evolutionary perspective to improving human well-being. The challenge now comes in transforming relevance into action and, for that, evolutionary behavioral anthropologists will need to forge deeper connections with other applied social scientists and policy-makers. We are hopeful that these developments are underway and that, with the current tide of enthusiasm for evidence-based approaches to policy, evolutionary anthropology is well positioned to make a strong contribution.},

  abstract = {Depression is well recognized to be rooted in the down-regulation of positive affect systems. This paper reviews some of the social and non-social theories that seek to explain the potential adaptive advantages of being able to tone down positive affect, and how dysfunctions in such affect control can occur in some contexts. Common to most evolutionary theories of depression is the view that loss of control over aversive events and/or major resources/rewards exert downward pressure on positive affect. Social theories, however, suggest that it is loss of control over the social environment that is particularly depressogenic. Two evolutionary theories (the attachment-loss, and the defeatloss theories) are briefly reviewed and their interaction considered. It is suggested that phenotypes for toning down positive affect, in the face of loss of control, may become more severe in the context of socially hostile, unsupportive and/or excessively competitive environments. The paper briefly considers how human competencies for self-evaluation in relation to others, rumination, selfcriticism, and modern social contexts can accentuate dysfunctional expressions of affect regulation.},

There was no sense that everyone had taken the day off so that the entire community could come together to lift you up and bring you back to joy. There was no acknowledgement of the depression as something invasive and external that could actually be cast out of you again. Instead, they would take people one at a time into these dingy little rooms and have them sit around for an hour or so to talk about bad things that had happened to them. We had to ask them to leave the country.''While this description of a psychological intervention for depression is in stark contrast with the standard weekly therapy sessions so common in the Western cultures, it would not make an evolutionary therapist surprised.

As acknowledged throughout the history of archaeological research, evolutionary biology broadly parallels these interests by also examining patterns of inheritance and diversity. Today, one of the most common frameworks used in evolutionary biology to infer patterns of macroevolution is Bayesian phylogenetic inference. Despite the popularity of this approach across the sciences, few worked examples can be found in the archaeological literature. This chapter closes this gap by providing a step-by-step application of a Bayesian phylogenetic approach to archaeological data from the Great Plains. We conclude that Bayesian methods are not only able to reconstruct evolutionary relationships in a more robust manner but also ask a new generation of questions about the pace of cultural change, periods of cultural divergence, and rates of cultural diversification.},

Evolutionary approaches to medicine may contribute to understanding why humans are vulnerable to AD and how to best approach research into clinical interventions. Since AD generally manifests late in life, it is often thought to be invisible to natural selection; however, an examination into APOE, the only unequivocal risk gene for AD, reveals that AD may, in fact, be subject to selection. Given this, antagonistic pleiotropy and environmental mismatch are explored as possibilities for our vulnerability to AD. In addition, the amyloid-{$\beta$} (A{$\beta$}) plaques and paired helical filament tau (PHFtau) neurofibrillary tangles that characterize AD are considered from the perspective of evolution. These disease hallmarks are generally thought to promote neurodegeneration in AD, but may in fact be harmless by-products of a pathological process such as oxidative stress, or even beneficial adaptations to protect the brain from actual harmful processes. The spread of misfolded A{$\beta$} and synaptic propagation of PHFtau is considered, as are comparative perspectives on AD-like patterns in nonhuman species. The implications of evolutionary thinking for clinical practice and research are evaluated, especially with regard to the caution that must be taken when directly targeting tau and amyloid, as many drug trials have recently attempted.},

  abstract = {Humans inhabit the widest range of ecological and social niches of any mammal. Yet each ecological and social environment presents a set of challenges that we must solve in order to successfully inhabit it. We are able to do so by building institutions that can flexibly respond to changing circumstances. Institutions that solve adaptive challenges necessary for human sociality, such as how to resolve conflicts, find mates, and extract and distribute resources, are termed locally adaptive institutions. The design of locally adaptive institutions promotes coordi\- nation and cooperation among unrelated individuals, reflecting the constraints of the particular ecological and social challenges to which they are responsive. Institutions generally are enabled by a suite of social and psy\- chological mechanisms, including norm compliance, self-interested design, selective imitation, and cultural group selection among others. The development of locally adaptive institutions are likely to be especially shaped by self-interested design in which agents are sensitive to the payoffs from various norms and choose to enforce and follow those which they anticipate to be most beneficial to themselves. Exogenous shocks, including the advent of material and cultural technologies, population pressures, or even group conflict can contribute to the modification of existing social institutions and the development of new social structures. Using several case examples from traditional east African pastoralist societies, I illustrate how ecological and social pressures shape the development of social norms that underlie locally adaptive social institutions and facilitate continued cooperation in the face of change at scales ranging from local to global.},

As the parental optimum is normally the absence of competition, the presence of sibling competition is an aspect of parent-offspring conflict. Phenotypic techniques are developed for modelling sibling competition in broods where all members have equal competitive ability. Two forms of sibling competition are modelled, one suggested by competition between nestling birds, and the second suggested by competition between the larvae of gregarious insects. The phenotypic models confirm the genetic analysis and allow the study of the relationship between sibling competition and clutch size (the genetic models assumed infinite clutch size). Conflict may either increase or decrease with clutch size depending on how the costs of competition are spread among the members of the brood. It is also shown that in the presence of sibling competition, parents may be selected to produce smaller clutches than those that would be optimum in the absence of sibling competition.},

If we have some moralobligation to secure the well-being of our future children (a questionexplored extensively in the literature on the non-identity problem;see the entry on the nonidentity problem), different questions come into focus: how far do suchobligations extend, what justifies them, and can related contemporarypractices be distinguished, in their aims, forms, justifications, andlikely consequences, from the clearly morally impermissible eugenicprograms of the past?, Philosophers have recently begun to explore the possibility of``liberal'' as opposed to ``authoritative''eugenics (Agar 2004). Liberal eugenics would be based upon individualfree choice, pluralist values, and up-to-date scientific understandingof genetics and epigenetics. Furthermore, advocates of liberaleugenics aim to be sensitive to the effects of problematic but deeplyentrenched social problems (e.g., racism, sexism, heterosexism) onindividual choice. Authoritative eugenics programs, in contrast, werecoercive state programs designed to promote social goods, and werebased on problematic assumptions about hereditability.

Victims of medium-level transgressions were angrier the more alternative potential mates there were that were closer to their ideal mate preferences than their current partner. Perpetrators of strong transgressions felt more shame the higher in mate value their partner was compared to them. Results suggest that different MVDs may predict different outcomes in relationships and highlight the importance of using functional theories of emotions to predict individual differences in emotional responses.},

  abstract = {Sexual harassment is pervasive and has adverse effects on its victims, yet perceiving sexual harassment is wrought with ambiguity, making harassment difficult to identify and understand. Eleven preregistered, multimethod experiments (total N Ï­ 4,065 participants) investigated the nature of perceiving sexual harassment by testing whether perceptions of sexual harassment and its impact are facilitated when harassing behaviors target those who fit with the prototype of women (e.g., those who have feminine features, interests, and characteristics) relative to those who fit less well with this prototype. Studies A1\textendash A5 demonstrate that participants' mental representation of sexual harassment targets overlapped with the prototypes of women as assessed through participant-generated drawings, face selection tasks, reverse correlation, and self-report measures. In Studies B1\textendash B4, participants were less likely to label incidents as sexual harassment when they targeted nonprototypical women compared with prototypical women. In Studies C1 and C2, participants perceived sexual harassment claims to be less credible and the harassment itself to be less psychologically harmful when the victims were nonprototypical women rather than prototypical women. This research offers theoretical and methodological advances to the study of sexual harassment through social cognition and prototypicality perspectives, and it has implications for harassment reporting and litigation as well as the realization of fundamental civil rights.

These were typically inconsistent across studies. Weighted mean odds ratios representing associations of these problems with violence ranged from 3.55 to 5.62, and were typically consistent across studies. Variability was accounted for by differences in sampling frames. Dose-response relationships of violence to depression and PTSD were observed. Although research has not addressed many criteria for causal inferences, the existing research is consistent with the hypothesis that intimate partner violence increases risk for mental health problems. The appropriate way to conceptualize these problems deserves careful attention.},

It has tripled in size from Australopithecines to modern humans1 and has become almost six times larger than expected for a placental mammal of human size2. Brains incur high metabolic costs3 and accordingly a long-standing question is why the large human brain has evolved4. The leading hypotheses propose benefits of improved cognition for overcoming ecological5\textendash 7, social8\textendash 10 or cultural11\textendash 14 challenges. However, these hypotheses are typically assessed using correlative analyses, and establishing causes for brain-size evolution remains difficult15,16. Here we introduce a metabolic approach that enables causal assessment of social hypotheses for brain-size evolution. Our approach yields quantitative predictions for brain and body size from formalized social hypotheses given empirical estimates of the metabolic costs of the brain. Our model predicts the evolution of adult Homo sapiens-sized brains and bodies when individuals face a combination of 60\% ecological, 30\% cooperative and 10\% between-group competitive challenges, and suggests that between-individual competition has been unimportant for driving human brain-size evolution. Moreover, our model indicates that brain expansion in Homo was driven by ecological rather than social challenges, and was perhaps strongly promoted by culture. Our metabolic approach thus enables causal assessments that refine, refute and unify hypotheses of brain-size evolution.},

  abstract = {Background. Much attention has been paid to the problem of postpartum depression in women. However, there is some indication that men also experience depression after the birth of a child, and that paternal depression is linked to maternal depression. Aims. The purpose of this integrative review was to examine current knowledge about postpartum depression in fathers. Specific aims were (1) to examine the incidence of paternal depression in the first year after the birth of a child, (2) to identify the characteristics and predictors of paternal postpartum depression, (3) to describe the relationship between maternal and paternal postpartum depression, and (4) to discuss the influence of paternal depression on the family and infant. Methods. A literature search from 1980 to 2002 was carried out using the CINAHL, PsychInfo, and Medline electronic databases. Twenty research studies were identified that included incidence rates of paternal depression during the first year postpartum. These were further examined and synthesized regarding onset, severity, duration, and predictors of paternal depressive symptoms, and for information about the relationship between maternal and paternal depression. Findings. During the first postpartum year, the incidence of paternal depression ranged from 1{$\cdot$}2\% to 25{$\cdot$}5\% in community samples, and from 24\% to 50\% among men whose partners were experiencing postpartum depression. Maternal depression was identified as the strongest predictor of paternal depression during the postpartum period. The implications of parental depression for family health were discussed. Conclusions. Postpartum depression in men is a significant problem. The strong correlation of paternal postpartum depression with maternal postpartum depression has important implications for family health and well-being. Consideration of postpartum depression in fathers as well as mothers, and consideration of co-occurrence of depression in couples, is an important next step in research and practice involving childbearing families.},

Across many species an extended childhood and high caregiving investment appear to be correlated with particular kinds of plasticity and learning. Human life history is particularly distinctive; humans evolved an exceptionally long childhood and old age, and an unusually high level of caregiving investment, at the same time that they evolved distinctive capacities for cognition and culture. The contributors explore the relations between life history, plasticity and learning across a wide range of methods and populations, including theoretical and empirical work in biology, anthropology and developmental psychology.This article is part of the theme issue `Life history and learning: how childhood, caregiving and old age shape cognition and culture in humans and other animals'.},

  abstract = {Testosterone is a key hormone for the development of secondary sexual characters and dimorphisms in behavior and morphology of male vertebrates. Because females often express detectable levels of testosterone, testosterone has been suggested to also play a role in the modulation of secondary sexual traits in females. Previous comparative analyses in birds and fish demonstrated a relationship between male-to-female testosterone ratios and the degree of sexual dimorphism. Furthermore, female maximum testosterone was related to mating system and coloniality. Here, we reevaluate these previous ideas using phylogenetic analyses and effect size measures for the relationship between birds' male-to-female maximum testosterone levels. Further, we investigate the seasonal androgen response of female birds (the difference from baseline to maximum testosterone), which in males is strongly related to mating system. We could not confirm a relationship between male-to-female testosterone, maximum female testosterone, or the seasonal androgen response of females with any life-history parameter. We conclude that the expectation that testosterone regulates traits in females in a similar manner as in males should be reconsidered. This expectation may be partially due to hormone manipulation studies using pharmacological doses of testosterone that had similar effects in females than in males but may be of limited importance for the physiological range of testosterone concentrations occurring within ecological and evolutionary contexts. Thus, the assumption that circulating testosterone should covary with ecologically relevant secondary sexual traits in females may be misleading: selection pressures on females differ from those on males and females may regulate behavior differently.},

Latent curve models were used first to estimate the trajectories of children's strategy use and metamemory and then to examine predictors of children's performance in each of these domains. Children's metamemory at the beginning of Grade 1 was linked to child- and home-level factors, whereas the development of both skills was related to maternal education level. Additional modeling of the longitudinal relations between strategic sorting and metacognitive knowledge indicated that metamemory at earlier time points was predictive of subsequent strategy use.},

Results of this review reveal both substantial progress (i.e., development of valid stressor assessment tools) and remaining problems (i.e., inconsistent measurement across studies). The second half of this article reviews studies that have tested for prospective associations between stressors and symptoms of psychopathology in children and adolescents. Studies that have examined the prospective effects of recent or prior stressors on current psychological symptoms, while controlling for prior psychological symptoms, are reviewed. Results overall suggest that stressors predict changes in rates of symptoms of psychopathology in children and adolescents over time.

The risks that may be associated with cannabis use, particularly for sensitive subgroups such as pregnant women, are difficult to define because of a paucity of dose-response data and the recent increase in cannabis potency. Although there is a large body of evidence detailing the mode of action of {$\Delta$}9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in adults, little work has focused on understanding how cannabis use during pregnancy may impact the development of the fetal nervous system and whether additional plant-derived cannabinoids might participate. This manuscript presents an overview of the historical and contemporary literature focused on the mode of action of THC in the developing brain, comparative pharmacokinetics in both pregnant and nonpregnant model systems and neurodevelopmental outcomes in exposed offspring. Despite growing public health significance, pharmacokinetic studies of THC have focused on nonpregnant adult subjects and there are few published reports on disposition parameters during pregnancy. Data from preclinical species show that THC readily crosses the placenta although fetal exposures appear lower than maternal exposures. The neurodevelopmental data in humans and animals suggest that prenatal exposure to THC may lead to subtle, persistent changes in targeted aspects of higher-level cognition and psychological well-being. There is an urgent need for well-controlled studies in humans and preclinical models on THC as a developmental neurotoxicant. Until more information is available, pregnant women should not assume that using cannabis during pregnancy is safe.},

However, this data can be more accurately thought of as `counts' (ie positive whole numbers) or quasi-counts (time is ratio, but discrete minutes of activity could be analysed as a count), and modelled using count distributions \textemdash{} including the Poisson and negative binomial distribution, and their zero-inflated and hurdle extensions, which model even more zeros. This paper demonstrates the easy application of these models to health psychology data, and their advantages over alternative ways of analysing this type of data.},

In this chapter, I use examples of immune system function and interactions between pathogens and human hosts to illustrate some of the ways that evolution-related insights are exploited to advance the aims of clinicians and public health officers. I first focus on the coevolutionary processes by which human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) evades neutralizing antibodies synthesized by host B-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes evolve such that the antibodies they secrete can bind better to HIV-1 variants. In particular, I address the critical roles of somatic hypermutation of antibody variable domain genes and selection of Blymphocytes in the production of potent and broadly neutralizing antibodies which are regarded as necessary for a highly efficacious vaccine intended to control the spread of a highly variable pathogen such as HIV-1. I also use other examples to illustrate the contributions of evolutionary thinking in immunology and infectious disease, including determining the paths of transmission of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, the effects of vaccines and antibiotics on pneumococcal epidemiology, and the patterns of antibiotic resistance in selected pathogens.},

Partly for historical reasons, these benefits have been more fully realized in studies that emphasize hunting than in those that focus on plant resources. Nonetheless, HBE-themed analyses of plant foraging have yielded useful insights into the economic logic of subsistence decisions. Creative modifications of simple models have brought them into better alignment with the distinctive characteristics of human actors and their plant resources. Other elaborations have taken into account the requirements of central place foraging, the effects of processing costs on return rates, and the implications of deferred consumption. More recently, researchers have revised classic foraging models to incorporate the effects of niche construction. Agent-based modeling is a particularly promising approach to understanding the complex social-ecological systems in which plant resource use is embedded.},

In Nobody's Normal, anthropologist Roy Richard Grinker chronicles the progress and setbacks in the struggle against mental-illness stigma\rule{1em}{1pt}from the eighteenth century, through America's major wars, and into today's high-tech economy.Nobody's Normal argues that stigma is a social process that can be explained through cultural history, a process that began the moment we defined mental illness, that we learn from within our communities, and that we ultimately have the power to change. Though the legacies of shame and secrecy are still with us today, Grinker writes that we are at the cusp of ending the marginalization of the mentally ill. In the twenty-first century, mental illnesses are fast becoming a more accepted and visible part of human diversity.Grinker infuses the book with the personal history of his family's four generations of involvement in psychiatry, including his grandfather's analysis with Sigmund Freud, his own daughter's experience with autism, and culminating in his research on neurodiversity. Drawing on cutting-edge science, historical archives, and cross-cultural research in Africa and Asia, Grinker takes readers on an international journey to discover the origins of, and variances in, our cultural response to neurodiversity.Urgent, eye-opening, and ultimately hopeful, Nobody's Normal explains how we are transforming mental illness and offers a path to end the shadow of stigma.},

The gut microbiome, and particularly the study of its origins in neonates, have become subtopics of great interest within the field of genomics. This brief review seeks to summarize recent literature regarding the origins and establishment of the neonatal gut microbiome, beginning in utero, and how it is affected by neonatal nutritional status (breastfed versus formula fed) and gestational age (term versus preterm). We also explore the role of dysbiosis, a perturbation within the fragile ecosystem of the microbiome, and its role in the origin of select pathologic states, specifically, obesity and necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants. We discuss the evidence supporting enteral pre- and probiotic supplementation of commensal organisms such as Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus in the neonatal period, and their role in the prevention and amelioration of necrotizing enterocolitis in premature infants. Finally, we review directions to consider for further research to promote human health within this field.},

Conversely, the perceived inability to meet expectations is associated with negative mental health consequences for mothers and fathers. In the present paper we examine the impact of parenting efficacy expectations on the mental health statuses of new parents. Using three waves of data spanning from the prenatal period to the 4-months postpartum period from a sample of 150 first-time mothers and fathers in the Midwestern United States, we find that parenting efficacy is negatively associated with postpartum depression (PPD) for both mothers and fathers throughout the transition period. We also find that mothers and fathers whose parenting efficacy experiences were more negative than expected reported higher levels of PPD at 1-month postpartum. This effect dissipates for mothers, but not fathers, by 4-months postpartum, suggesting differences in the experiences of mothers and fathers during this transition. We conclude that research on the transition to parenthood should continue to include fathers in an effort to better understand the mental health consequences of becoming a parent for the first time, as well as enhance interventions designed to assist couples experiencing this important transition.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The US guidelines recommend avoiding marijuana during breastfeeding given concerns about infant's neurodevelopment. In this setting, some physicians and hospitals recommend against or prohibit breastfeeding when marijuana use is detected during pregnancy. However, breastfeeding is beneficial for infants and women, and stigmatization of substance use in pregnancy has been historically linked to punitive approaches with a disproportionate impact on minority populations. We advance an empirically informed ethical analysis of this issue. METHODS: First, we performed a retrospective cross-sectional qualitative study of prenatal and postpartum records from a random sample of 150 women delivered in an academic hospital system in 2017 to provide evidence and context regarding breastfeeding management in relation to marijuana use. We then perform a scoping literature review on infant risks from breastmilk marijuana exposure and risks associated with not breastfeeding for infants and women. Finally, we analyze this issue vis-a-vis ethical principles of beneficence, autonomy, and justice. RESULTS: (1) Medical records reveal punitive language pertaining to the medicinal use of marijuana in pregnancy and misinterpretation of national guidelines, e.g., "patient caught breastfeeding and instructed to stop." (2) Though there are plausible neurodevelopmental harms from breastmilk exposure to THC, evidence of infant effects from breastmilk exposure to marijuana is limited and largely confounded by concomitant pregnancy exposure and undisclosed exposures. By contrast, health benefits of breastfeeding for women and infants are well-established, as are harms of forgoing breastfeeding. (3) Discouraging breastfeeding for women with marijuana use in pregnancy contradicts beneficence, as it neglects women's health considerations and incorrectly assumes that risks exceed benefits for infants. Restrictive hospital practices (e.g., withholding lactation support) compromise maternal autonomy and exploit power asymmetry between birthing persons and institutions, particularly when compulsory toxicology screening prompts child welfare investigations. Finally, recommending against breastfeeding during prenatal care and imposing restrictions during postpartum hospitalization may exacerbate racial disparities in breastfeeding and related health outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Policy interpretations which discourage rather than encourage breastfeeding among women who use of marijuana may cause net harm, compromise autonomy, and disproportionately threaten health and wellbeing of underserved women and infants.},

The human life history, characterized by an extended altricial period during early childhood, required cooperation in the form of pair-bonding, alloparenting, intergenerational transfers of calories, and extensive cooperative food sharing among kin and non-kin. Cooperating to achieve mutual goals often led to better outcomes compared to uncoordinated individual efforts. However, avoiding exploitation was critical to managing challenges of sociality. Building on a socio-functional perspective, we summarize evidence showcasing the role emotion plays in guiding proximate mechanisms that facilitate cooperation or hinder competition through their effect on partner choice and relationship management. We further organize these emotions (e.g., compassion, sadness, gratitude, anger, shame, guilt) by their proposed interpersonal ultimate functions based on the ways in which they promote cooperation via 1) Distinguishing high-value from low-value partners, 2) Building and maintaining lasting cooperative relationships with valuable partners; and 3) Identifying when to de-invest from or terminate existing relationships.},

Consistently high food producers who give more than they receive, however, gain the least risk-reduction benefit from this daily pooling because they are the least likely to go without food on any given day. Why then do some high producers consistently share food, and why do some average producers share proportionally more food than others? We propose that although these individuals may not receive the same amounts they give (i.e., strict Tit-for-Tat), one explanation for their generosity is that they receive additional food during hard times. These include brief episodes of sickness, disease, injury, or accidents\textemdash fairly common events in traditional societies that can render individuals incapable of producing food, thereby having long-term effects on morbidity and fecundity and ultimately on lifetime reproductive success. Data collected among the Ache, a group of South American forager-horticulturists, indicate that those who shared and produced more than average (signaling cooperative intent and/or ability to produce) were rewarded with more food from more people when injured or sick than those who shared and produced below average. These results, framed within the context of tradeoffs between short-term and long-term fitness, may provide insight into motivations behind costly expenditures for establishing and reinforcing status and reputation.},

The uniqueness of pervasive sharing among humans, especially among unrelated individuals, has led researchers to evaluate numerous hypotheses about the adaptive functions and patterns of sharing in different ecologies. This article attempts to organize available crosscultural evidence pertaining to several contentious evolutionary models: kin selection, reciprocal altruism, tolerated scrounging, and costly signaling. Debates about the relevance of these models focus primarily on the extent to which individuals exert control over the distribution of foods they acquire, and the extent to which donors receive food or other fitness-enhancing benefits in return for shares given away. Each model can explain some of the variance in sharing patterns within groups, and so generalizations that ignore or deny the importance of any one model may be misleading. Careful multivariate analyses and cross-cultural comparisons of food transfer patterns are therefore necessary tools for assessing aspects of the sexual division of labor, human life history evolution, and the evolution of the family. This article also introduces a framework for better understanding variation in sharing behavior across small-scale traditional societies. I discuss the importance of resource ecology and the degree of coordination in acquisition activities as a key feature that influences sharing behavior.},

Average life expectancy has increased linearly at almost three months per year over the past 160 years, with improvements in sanitation, nutrition, and public health accounting for much of this change (Riley 2001; Oeppen and Vaupel 2003). As a consequence of longevity in the developed world, women currently live more than a third of their lives in a post-reproductive state following menopause. Such high survival rates almost surely had never occurred before in human history. Agriculture and pastoralism have been practiced for only about 10,000 years, and most extensively in the past 5,000 years. The ge-nus Homo has existed for about 2 million years, and humans have lived as hunter-gatherers for the vast majority of their evolutionary history. While some important genetic changes may have occurred in populations after the advent of agriculture, the major distinctive features of our species (Wang et al. 2006), such as large brains, long lives, marriage and male investment in offspring, long child dependency on parents, and grandparental support of grandchildren, appear to have evolved during our preagricultural history (see Kaplan 1997 for reviews; Kaplan et al. 2000, 2001). Despite recent im-provements in human survivorship, it is likely that the age-specific mortal-ity pattern and the timing and pace of development and senescence evolved during our hunter-gatherer past as well. The purpose of this article is to assess the evolved human mortality profile and particularly the pattern of senescent mortality change with age.

This bioeconomic framework subsumes both cooperative and conflictive views on the sexual division of labor.

  abstract = {Humans are the longest living and slowest growing of all primates. Although most primates are social, humans are highly cooperative and social in ways that likely co-evolved with the slow human life history. In this paper we highlight the role of resource transfers and non-material assistance within and across generations in shaping low human mortality rates. The use of complex cooperative strategies to minimize risk is a necessary precursor for selecting further reductions in mortality rate in late adulthood. In conjunction with changes in the age-profile of production, the impacts of resource transfers and other forms of cooperation on reducing mortality likely played an important role in selection on post-reproductive lifespan throughout human evolution. Using medical data and ethnographic interviews, we explore several types of common risks experienced by Tsimane forager\textendash horticulturalists, and quantify the types and targets of aid. Our results illustrate the importance of transfers in several key domains and suggest that the absence of transfers would greatly increase human mortality rates throughout the life course.},

  abstract = {Sharing and exchange are common practices for minimizing food insecurity in rural populations. The advent of markets and monetization in egalitarian indigenous populations presents an alternative means of managing risk, with the potential impact of eroding traditional networks. We test whether market involvement buffers several types of risk and reduces traditional sharing behavior among Tsimane Amerindians of the Bolivian Amazon. Results vary based on type of market integration and scale of analysis (household vs. village), consistent with the notion that local culture and ecology shape risk management strategies. Greater wealth and income were unassociated with the reliance on others for food, or on reciprocity, but wealth was associated with a greater proportion of food given to others (i.e., giving intensity) and a greater number of sharing partners (i.e., sharing breadth). Across villages, greater mean income was negatively associated with reciprocity, but economic inequality was positively associated with giving intensity and sharing breadth. Incipient market integration does not necessarily replace traditional buffering strategies but instead can often enhance social capital.},

Second, it describes the plasticity in life span in both species with improved conditions. Despite some similarities in early life mortality patterns, chimpanzees have shorter potential maximal life spans than humans. Humans everywhere have a substantial postreproductive life span, whereas chimpanzees mostly do not, and some robust females are capable of reproducing until the end of their adult lives. To help contextualize these species differences in survivorship, and presumably in aging, the chapter summarizes what is known about causes of death both in the wild and under more modern conditions, in both young and old. It examines species differences in senescence rates, discusses the selection pressures that may have helped shape the distinct life histories of humans and chimpanzees. The chapter evaluates leading hypotheses that might help explain why humans are longer-lived than chimpanzees. It links life history changes with species differences in social behavior, and concludes with suggestions for future directions. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

Yet, BTs have declined over the past two centuries in the United States, coinciding with reductions in infection and increasing life expectancy. The generality of and reasons behind this phenomenon have not yet been well studied. Here, we show that Bolivian forager-farmers (n = 17,958 observations of 5481 adults age 15+ years) inhabiting a pathogen-rich environment exhibited higher BT when first examined in the early 21st century (\textasciitilde 37.0\textdegree C). BT subsequently declined by \textasciitilde 0.05\textdegree C/year over 16 years of socioeconomic and epidemiological change to \textasciitilde 36.5\textdegree C by 2018. As predicted, infections and other lifestyle factors explain variation in BT, but these factors do not account for the temporal declines. Changes in physical activity, body composition, antibiotic usage, and thermal environment are potential causes of the temporal decline. Body temperature in tropical forager-farmers declined as much in the past two decades as among Americans in the past 150 years.

We reviewed available data on the prevalence of alcohol intake during lactation, the influence of alcohol on breastfeeding, the pharmacokinetics of alcohol in lactating women and nursing infants and the effects of alcohol intake on nursing infants. A systematic search was performed in PubMed from origin to May 2013, and 41 publications were included in the review. Approximately half of all lactating women in Western countries consume alcohol while breastfeeding. Alcohol intake inhibits the milk ejection reflex, causing a temporary decrease in milk yield. The alcohol concentrations in breast milk closely resemble those in maternal blood. The amount of alcohol presented to nursing infants through breast milk is approximately 5\textendash 6\% of the weight-adjusted maternal dose, and even in a theoretical case of binge drinking, the children would not be subjected to clinically relevant amounts of alcohol. Newborns metabolize alcohol at approximately half the rate of adults. Minute behavioural changes in infants exposed to alcohol-containing milk have been reported, but the literature is contradictory. Any long-term consequences for the children of alcohol-abusing mothers are yet unknown, but occasional drinking while breastfeeding has not been convincingly shown to adversely affect nursing infants. In conclusion, special recommendations aimed at lactating women are not warranted. Instead, lactating women should simply follow standard recommendations on alcohol consumption.},

These findings also remain robust to alternative statistical specifications. Conclusions From a theoretical standpoint, our findings suggest that height is important in explaining life-satisfaction independent of other well-known determinants. From a methodological standpoint, the findings of this study highlight the need to explicitly control for the effect of heights in studies on subjective well-being, happiness, and life-satisfaction.},

  abstract = {Food insecurity is a major health problem that has pervasive effects on many human biological outcomes. In particular, there are compelling theoretical and empirical reasons to expect that the relationship between food insecurity may be directly related to mental health morbidities, and may be quantifiable in developing country settings. This preliminary study examined whether caretaker reports of food insecurity were associated with anxiety and depression among four ethnic groups in two communities of rural Tanzania. In-home interviews were conducted in June\textendash August of 2005 among female caretakers (n = 449). In addition to collecting household and demographic data, modified versions of the USDA's food security module and Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL) were used to measure food insecurity and anxiety and depression. Consistent with predictions, the results showed a strong positive correlation between a caretaker's score on the food insecurity instrument and her summed response on the HSCL (P {$<$} 0.0001). This association was maintained in all four ethnic groups, even when controlling for individual-level covariates such as caretaker's age and marital status. Issues of causality and hypotheses that might explain this robust finding are discussed, as are methodological and theoretical implications. Am. J. Hum.

Lack of paternal or social support will increase the costs born by mothers, whereas infant health problems will reduce the evolutionary benefits to be gained. Numerous studies support the correlation between postpartum depression (PPD) and lack of social support or indicators of possible infant health and development problems. PPD may be an adaptation that informs mothers that they are suffering or have suffered a fitness cost, which motivates them to reduce or eliminate investment in offspring under certain circumstances, and that may help them negotiate greater levels of investment from others. PPD also appears to be a good model for depression in general.},

Hum. Behav. 20 (1999) 325.]. If so, such social constraints should be associated with depression, and depression in one partner should be associated with increased investment by other partners. Several predictions of this hypothesis were tested using postpartum depression (PPD) as a model for depression in general. The depression levels, abortion attitudes, additional mating opportunities, and investment in childrearing of 240 mothers and fathers with a new child were measured using self-report instruments. Mothers were also asked whether the new child was planned and whether it was wanted. Perceived constraints on abortion correlated significantly with PPD levels, but, as predicted, only for mothers with an unplanned or unwanted child. Contrary to predictions, perceived constraints imposed by family and friends did not correlate with PPD levels. Sexual opportunities correlated significantly with PPD levels, but, as predicted, only for men. As predicted, PPD levels in one spouse correlated significantly with increased investment in childrearing as reported by the other spouse. PPD levels correlated positively with parity for older women with few future reproductive opportunities, as predicted.},

Major depression is characterized by additional symptoms\textemdash such as loss of interest in virtually all activities and suicidality\textemdash that have no obvious utility. The frequent association of these severe and disabling symptoms with apparently functional symptoms like sadness and low mood challenges a functional account of depression as a whole. Given that the principle cause of major unipolar depression is a significant negative life event, and that its characteristic symptom is a loss of interest in virtually all activities, it is possible that this syndrome functions somewhat like a labor strike. When powerful others are benefiting from an individual's efforts, but the individual herself is not benefiting, she can, by reducing her productivity, put her value to them at risk in order to compel their consent and assistance in renegotiating the social contract so that it will yield net fitness benefits for her. In partial support of this hypothesis, depression is associated with the receipt of considerable social benefits despite the negative reaction it causes in others.},

  abstract = {Long before the term Machiavellian Intelligence was coined, James Neel, a prominent geneticist, was pondering the role of `princes' in the evolution of exceptional human intelligence. Neel discovered that in small-scale societies resembling those in which humans evolved, leaders had more wives and more children than other men. If this pattern, which is now well-established in the ethnographic record, characterized ancestral human societies, whatever traits predisposed men to become leaders would have experienced strong sexual selection. Neel proposed that the key trait was intelligence. Sexual selection on intelligent leaders therefore helped explain human encephalization.},

However, the epidemics of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease suggest that there are also drawbacks to modern living. Here, we address the question of whether the dramatic cultural changes that have occurred over the past century have inflated rates of postpartum depression, adding postpartum depression to the list of ``diseases of modern civilization.'' We review evidence from cross-cultural, epidemiological, and experimental studies documenting associations between postpartum depression and modern patterns of early weaning, diets deficient in essential fatty acids, low levels of physical activity, low levels of sun exposure, and isolation from kin support networks, all of which mark significant divergences from lifestyles believed to have been typical throughout human evolutionary history. This ``mismatch hypothesis'' of postpartum depression integrates research across diverse research areas and generates novel predictions.},

Hahn examines how Western and non-Western cultures influence the definition, experience, and treatment of sickness.  Hahn begins by developing a definition of sickness that is based on the patient's perception of suffering and disturbance rather than on the physician's assessment of biomedical signs. After reviewing the principal theories that account for the forms of sickness and healing found in different historical and cultural situations, he explores the relevance of both anthropological and epidemiological approaches to sickness, focusing on the persistent gap between white and black infant mortality in the United States. Hahn then describes contemporary Western medicine as it might be seen by a visiting foreign anthropologist. He delineates the culture of Western medicine and portrays the world of one physician at work, traces the evolution of obstetrics since 1903 by analyzing the principal textbook--Williams Obstetrics--through its first eighteen editions, and explores the gulf between physicians and their patients by examining the accounts of physicians who have written about their own illnesses. He concludes by proposing ways in which some of the ills of contemporary Western medicine might be remedied by applying anthropological principles to medical training and practice.},

There has been a recent surge of interest in modelling the social implications of care provision for people with serious disabilities in bioarchaeology. However, there is a lack of acknowledgement of infant and child care in bioarchaeology, despite the significant labour and resources that are required, and the implications this has for health outcomes within societies. Drawing on the recent proliferation of studies on infancy and childhood in evolutionary anthropology and bioarchaeology, this paper presents ways the subdisciplines may draw on research developments from each field to advance a more holistic understanding of the evolutionary, social and health significance of infant and children care in the past.},

For the power/status dimension, we use the term ``vertical dimension of social relations'' to encompass a wide assortment of conceptually related definitions including hierarchical role (preexistent or manipulated), personality dominance, social status, social class, and feelings of power. The following topics in nonverbal communication are reviewed: (1) beliefs and stereotypes about the relation of the vertical dimension to nonverbal behavior, (2) perceptions of verticality based on viewing nonverbal behavior, (3) impact of power-relevant bodily positions on behavior and cognition (embodiment), (4) relation of people's verticality to their nonverbal behavior, (5) accuracy of judging others' verticality, and (6) relation of people's verticality to accuracy in interpreting others' states and traits, and in recalling their verbal or nonverbal behavior. In all domains, the evidence indicated that verticality is related to nonverbal communication though the relations can be complex and inconsistent. Much research remains to be done on mediators as well as moderators, including differences among the different definitions of the verticality construct.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Early research with nationally representative samples suggested that women reported initiating violence as often as men. Such research has been criticized as focusing only on participation rates, and not assessing gender differences in impact, context, and motivation for using partner violence. Furthermore, research with nationally representative samples has been largely a-theoretical and may lack relevance to those working with clinical samples. Research with clinical populations has begun to address gender similarity and differences in the commission and experience of partner violence. The present article reviews research on men's and women's partner violence using a model for examining such gender differences that incorporates key elements of partner violence, including initiation of the overall pattern of partner violence, proportional initiation rates of violent episodes, physical and mental health impacts of partner violence, behavioral and emotional responses to partner-initiated violence, motivations for using partner violence, and fearfulness of partner-initiated violence. The review concludes that, within and across clinical samples, women are disproportionately victimized by partner violence compared to men. Implications for research, clinical programs, and policy development are discussed.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Intimate partner violence (IPV) is regarded by key stakeholders involved in shaping arrest and intervention policies as a gendered problem. The prevailing assumptions guiding these policies, centered on patriarchal social structures and men's motivation to dominate their female partners, have collectively been called the {$<$}italic{$>$}gender paradigm{$<$}/italic{$>$}. When states started to enact laws against domestic violence in the late 1970s, it was due to the efforts of battered women and their allies, including second wave feminists fighting for the political, social, and economic advancement of women. The focus was on life-threatening forms of abuse in which women represented, and continue to represent, the much larger share of victims. Since then, IPV has been found to be a more complex problem than originally framed, perpetrated by women as well as men, driven by an assortment of motives, and associated with distal and proximate risk factors that have little to do with gender. Nonetheless, the gender paradigm persists, with public policy lagging behind the empirical evidence. The author suggests some reasons why this is so, among them the much higher rates of violent crimes committed by men, media influence and cognitive biases, political factors, and perpetuation of the very sex-role stereotypes that feminists have sought to extinguish in every other social domain. He then critically reviews two theories used in support of the paradigm, sexual selection theory and social role theory, and explores how empirically driven policies would more effectively lower IPV rates in our communities, while advancing core feminist principles.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

And maybe we will get as much mileage from studies of individual differences in stress generation and stress resolution as from a previous round of studies of individual differences in cognitions about stress. How do people create and manage their environments? Just as the study of depression has profited enormously from exploring its antecedent social context, we propose that even stressful events need to be studied in context\textemdash especially the interpersonal and family context. These processes shift over time and have mutual influences on each other.

We aimed to investigate the potential moderating effect of SES on the association between HGS and depressive symptoms and the potential mediating effect of HGS on the association between SES and depressive symptoms using a nationally representative sample of older adults. Method Data from 3169 community-dwelling adults aged 60 years or older were acquired from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey conducted in 2014 and 2016. HGS was measured using a digital hand-grip dynamometer. Depressive symptoms were evaluated using the 9-item version of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). SES was assessed using equivalent monthly household income and education level. Results Older adults in the lowest tertile of HGS measures were more likely to have experienced depressive symptoms compared to those in the highest tertile (odds ratio\,=\,1.95, 95\% confidence interval\,=\,1.25\textendash 2.74). A significant moderating effect of household income level was observed on the association between HGS and PHQ-9 score (P\,=\,0.014). Older adults with a low income had a stronger inverse correlation between HGS and PHQ-9 score compared to those with a high income (low income: beta\,=\,~-0.162, P~{$<~$}0.001; high income: beta\,=\,-0.119, P\,=\,0.036). HGS partially mediated the association between low income and depressive symptoms. Conclusion Our findings indicate that there may be a stronger relationship between low HGS and depressive symptoms in socioeconomically deprived older people. Further research on muscle strength and income level in older adults is required regarding depression risk assessment.},

To frame this decade in review, we organize the research published since 2010 at each of four ecological levels (individual, relational, community, and sociocultural) to demonstrate advances and gaps in each. At the individual and relational level, we review the prevalence, directionality, typologies, predictors, and outcomes of IPV. We attend to postseparation dynamics as well as research on youth exposure. We also discuss key theoretical advances. Our review of individual and relational research is more substantial as most research on IPV focuses on these factors with less attention to community and sociocultural contexts. Reflecting the state of the research within each ecological level, we review men's violence against women and incorporate developing research on men's victimization, reciprocal violence between men and women, and IPV among same-sex partners. Throughout the review, we address key developments in knowledge as well as gaps and methodological strengths and limitations. We close with an integrated summary and recommendations for rigorous collaborative research across disciplines in the next decade to broaden our knowledge base and inform preventions and interventions.},

Comparisons with nonhuman apes point to our early-emerging cooperative-communicative abilities as crucial to the evolution of all forms of human cultural cognition, including language. The human selfdomestication hypothesis proposes that these early-emerging social skills evolved when natural selection favored increased in-group prosociality over aggression in late human evolution. As a by-product of this selection, humans are predicted to show traits of the domestication syndrome observed in other domestic animals. In reviewing comparative, developmental, neurobiological, and paleoanthropological research, compelling evidence emerges for the predicted relationship between unique human mentalizing abilities, tolerance, and the domestication syndrome in humans. This synthesis includes a review of the first a priori test of the self-domestication hypothesis as well as predictions for future tests.},

Such credulity is consistent with a long-standing philosophical and scientific conception of young children as prone to indiscriminate trust. Against this conception, we argue that children trust some informants more than others. In particular, they use two major heuristics. First, they keep track of the history of potential informants. Faced with conflicting claims, they endorse claims made by someone who has provided reliable care or reliable information in the past. Second, they monitor the cultural standing of potential informants. Faced with conflicting claims, children endorse claims made by someone who belongs to a consensus and whose behaviour abides by, rather than deviating from, the norms of their group. The first heuristic is likely to promote receptivity to information offered by familiar caregivers, whereas the second heuristic is likely to promote a broader receptivity to informants from the same culture.},

In the hopes of aiding ongoing efforts to alleviate the burden of SITBs in this vulnerable population, the present study summarizes current knowledge on the efficacy of SITB interventions in children and adolescents. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing treatment effects on SITBs in child and adolescent populations. A total of 112 articles comprising 558 effect sizes were included in analyses. Nearly all interventions produced nonsignificant reductions in SITBs. For binary SITB outcomes, a nonsignificant treatment effect was detected, with an RR of 1.06 (95\% CIs [0.99, 1.14]). For continuous SITB outcomes, analyses also yielded a nonsignificant treatment effect (g\,=\,-\,0.04 [-\,0.12, 0.05]). These patterns were largely consistent across SITB outcomes, regardless of intervention type, treatment components, sample and study characteristics, and publication year. Our findings highlight opportunities for improving SITB intervention development and implementation in child and adolescent populations. The most efficacious interventions are likely to directly target the causes of SITBs; therefore, future research is needed to identify the causal processes underlying the onset and maintenance of SITBs in youth.},

These studies have documented that some students do use self-testing (but largely for monitoring memory) and rereading, but the researchers did not assess whether individual differences in strategy use were related to student achievement. Thus, we surveyed 324 undergraduates about their study habits as well as their college grade point average (GPA). Importantly, the survey included questions about self-testing, scheduling one's study, and a checklist of strategies commonly used by students or recommended by cognitive research. Use of self-testing and rereading were both positively associated with GPA. Scheduling of study time was also an important factor: Low performers were more likely to engage in late-night studying than were high performers; massing (vs. spacing) of study was associated with the use of fewer study strategies overall; and all students\textemdash but especially low performers\textemdash were driven by impending deadlines. Thus, self-testing, rereading, and scheduling of study play important roles in real-world student achievement.},

Raised levels of cytokines have been shown to increase depressive behaviour in animal models, while many anti-depressants reverse this behaviour alongside reducing the Central Nervous System (CNS) inflammatory response and reduction in the amounts of inflammatory cytokines. Cytokines reduce neurogenesis, Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and neuronal plasticity in the CNS, while many anti-depressants have been shown to reverse these processes. The considerations of anti-depressants as anti-inflammatory agents, and implication of other anti-inflammatory therapeutics for the treatment of depression are pointed out.},

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In-person interviews with a representative sample of US noninstitutionalized civilian adults (Õ18 years) (n = 36 309) who participated in the 2012-2013 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions III (NESARC-III). Data were collected from April 2012 to June 2013 and were analyzed in 2016-2017. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Prevalence of DSM-5 MDD and the DSM-5 specifiers. Odds ratios (ORs), adjusted ORs (aORs), and 95\% CIs indicated associations with demographic characteristics and other psychiatric disorders. RESULTS Of the 36 309 adult participants in NESARC-III, 12-month and lifetime prevalences of MDD were 10.4\% and 20.6\%, respectively. Odds of 12-month MDD were significantly lower in men (OR, 0.5; 95\% CI, 0.46-0.55) and in African American (OR, 0.6; 95\% CI, 0.54-0.68), Asian/Pacific Islander (OR, 0.6; 95\% CI, 0.45-0.67), and Hispanic (OR, 0.7; 95\% CI, 0.62-0.78) adults than in white adults and were higher in younger adults (age range, 18-29 years; OR, 3.0; 95\% CI, 2.48-3.55) and those with low incomes (\$19 999 or less; OR, 1.7; 95\% CI, 1.49-2.04). Associations of MDD with psychiatric disorders ranged from an aOR of 2.1 (95\% CI, 1.84-2.35) for specific phobia to an aOR of 5.7 (95\% CI, 4.98-6.50) for generalized anxiety disorder. Associations of MDD with substance use disorders ranged from an aOR of 1.8 (95\% CI, 1.63-2.01) for alcohol to an aOR of 3.0 (95\% CI, 2.57-3.55) for any drug. Most lifetime MDD cases were moderate (39.7\%) or severe (49.5\%). Almost 70\% with lifetime MDD had some type of treatment. Functioning among those with severe MDD was approximately 1 SD below the national mean. Among 12.9\% of those with lifetime MDD, all episodes occurred just after the death of someone close and lasted less than 2 months. The anxious/distressed specifier characterized 74.6\% of MDD cases, and the mixed-features specifier characterized 15.5\%. Controlling for severity, both specifiers were associated with early onset, poor course and functioning, and suicidality. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among US adults, DSM-5 MDD is highly prevalent, comorbid, and disabling. While most cases received some treatment, a substantial minority did not. Much remains to be learned about the DSM-5 MDD specifiers in the general population.},

We report the first meta-analysis of taxometric research, examining 317 findings drawn from 183 articles that employed an index of the comparative fit of observed data to dimensional and taxonic data simulations. Findings supporting dimensional models outnumbered those supporting taxonic models five to one. There were systematic differences among 17 construct domains in support for the two models, but psychopathology was no more likely to generate taxonic findings than normal variation (i.e. individual differences in personality, response styles, gender, and sexuality). No content domain showed aggregate support for the taxonic model. Six variables \textendash{} alcohol use disorder, intermittent explosive disorder, problem gambling, autism, suicide risk, and pedophilia \textendash{} emerged as the most plausible taxon candidates based on a preponderance of independently replicated findings. We also compared the 317 meta-analyzed findings to 185 additional taxometric findings from 96 articles that did not employ the comparative fit index. Studies that used the index were 4.88 times more likely to generate dimensional findings than those that did not after controlling for construct domain, implying that many taxonic findings obtained before the popularization of simulation-based techniques are spurious. The meta-analytic findings support the conclusion that the great majority of psychological differences between people are latently continuous, and that psychopathology is no exception.},

However, men may have more to gain by giving food to a wide range of companions who treat them favorably in return. If so, and if some resources better serve this end, men's foraging behavior should vary accordingly. Aspects of this hypothesis are tested on observations of food acquisition and sharing among Ache foragers of Eastern Paraguay. Previous analysis showed that different Ache food types were differently shared. Resources shared most widely were game animals. Further analysis and additional data presented here suggest a causal association between the wide sharing of game and the fact that men hunt and women do not. Data show that men preferentially target resources in both hunting and gathering which are more widely shared, resources more likely to be consumed outside their own nuclear families. These results have implications for 1) the identification of male reproductive trade-offs in human societies, 2) the view that families are units of common interest integrated by the sexual division of labor, 3) current reconstructions of the evolution of foraging and food sharing among early hominids, and 4) assessments of the role of risk and reciprocity in hunter-gatherer foraging strategies.},

The Hunting Hypothesis proposes this pattern evolved in early Homo when ancestral mothers began relying on their mates' hunting to provision dependent offspring. Evidence for this idea comes from hunter-gatherer ethnography, but data we collected in the 1980s among East African Hadza do not support it. There, men targeted big game to the near exclusion of other prey even though they were rarely successful and most of the meat went to others, at significant opportunity cost to their own families. Based on Hadza data collected more recently, Wood and Marlowe contest our position, affirming the standard view of men's foraging as family provisioning. Here we compare the two studies, identify similarities, and show that emphasis on big game results in collective benefits that would not be supplied if men foraged mainly to provision their own households. Male status competition remains a likely explanation for Hadza focus on big game, with implications for hypotheses about the deeper past.},

These initiatives have garnered much attention from anthropologists, who have long been interested in the social life of credit and debt. Despite numerous anthropological studies critiquing the social and economic consequences of such lending practices, they continue, bolstered by the affective dimensions of philanthropic marketing and the current embeddedness of microloans in local economies. This contradiction has led to more recent ethnographic work demonstrating the interaction of microloans with other forms of debt and credit in the social economy of borrowers. Building on this recent work, this article draws on ethnographic data from microloan borrowers in northern Honduras and the Bay Islands and contends that the activities associated with microlending participation and repayment may be understood as a form of productive, though hidden, labor. The article suggests further avenues of inquiry into the long-term economic and cultural transformations that microlending has precipitated.},

Objective: To examine differences in LTPA, work-related physical activity (WRPA; heavy household chores and strenuous job activities), and total physical activity (TPA) by race, ethnicity, and education. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional analyses of data from the 1992 Health and Retirement Study for a nationally representative cohort of 9,621 community-dwelling adults aged 51\textendash 61 years. Measurements: Physical activity scores for LTPA, WRPA, and TPA based upon self-reported frequency of light or vigorous recreational activities, heavy household chores, and strenuous job-related physical activities. Main Results: LTPA was lower for blacks and Hispanics compared to whites, and LTPA steadily declined with lower levels of education. WRPA showed the reverse pattern, being lowest for whites and persons with greater education. Education was far more important than race/ethnicity as a determinant of LTPA and WRPA in multivariate analyses. After adjusting for differences in overall health and physical functioning, mean TPA scores were similar across racial/ethnic and education categories; blacks ({$\beta$}=1.0; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.5 to 1.5) and Spanish-speaking Hispanics ({$\beta$}=1.1; 95\% CI, 0.3 to 1.9) had slightly higher levels of TPA than whites (P{$<$}.01 and P=.01, respectively). Conclusions: Differences in educational attainment and health status accounted for virtually all of the racial and ethnic differences in LTPA.

  abstract = {,  According to Hamilton's rule, matrilineal-biased investment restrains men in matrilineal societies from maximising their inclusive fitness (the `matrilineal puzzle'). A recent hypothesis argues that when women breed communally and share household resources, a man should help his sisters' household, rather than his wife's household, as investment to the later but not the former would be diluted by other unrelated members (Wu et al., 2013). According to this hypothesis, a man is less likely to help on his wife's farm when there are more women reproducing in the wife's household, because on average he would be less related to his wife's household. We used a farm-work observational dataset, that we collected in the matrilineal Mosuo in southwest China, to test this hypothesis. As predicted, high levels of communal breeding by women in his wife's households do predict less effort spent by men on their wife's farm, and communal breeding in men's natal households do not affect whether men help on their natal farms. Thus, communal breeding by women dilutes the inclusive fitness benefits men receive from investment to their wife and children, and may drive the evolution of matrilineal-biased investment by men. These results can help solve the `matrilineal puzzle'.},

  abstract = {Black Skin, White Coats is a history of psychiatry in Nigeria from the 1950s to the 1980s. Working in the contexts of decolonization and anticolonial nationalism, Nigerian psychiatrists sought to replace racist colonial psychiatric theories about the psychological inferiority of Africans with a universal and egalitarian model focusing on broad psychological similarities across cultural and racial boundaries. Particular emphasis is placed on Dr. T. Adeoye Lambo, the first indigenous Nigerian to earn a specialty degree in psychiatry in the United Kingdom in 1954. Lambo returned to Nigeria to become the medical superintendent of the newly founded Aro Mental Hospital in Abeokuta, Nigeria's first ``modern'' mental hospital. At Aro, Lambo began to revolutionize psychiatric research and clinical practice in Nigeria, working to integrate ``modern'' western medical theory and technologies with ``traditional'' cultural understandings of mental illness. Lambo's research focused on deracializing psychiatric thinking and redefining mental illness in terms of a model of universal human similarities that crossed racial and cultural divides.Black Skin, White Coats is the first work to focus primarily on black Africans as producers of psychiatric knowledge and as definers of mental illness in their own right. By examining the ways that Nigerian psychiatrists worked to integrate their psychiatric training with their indigenous backgrounds and cultural and civic nationalisms, Black Skin, White Coats provides a foil to Frantz Fanon's widely publicized reactionary articulations of the relationship between colonialism and psychiatry. Black Skin, White Coats is also on the cutting edge of histories of psychiatry that are increasingly drawing connections between local and national developments in late-colonial and postcolonial settings and international scientific networks. Heaton argues that Nigerian psychiatrists were intimately aware of the need to engage in international discourses as part and parcel of the transformation of psychiatry at home.},

  abstract = {Ancient Greek visual representations of the recovery of Helen by Menelaos are generally thought to depend closely on two distinct poetic sources. This paper argues that this belief is untenable. The principal theoretical assumption underlying it, that there will always be a close fit between ancient Greek poetic and artistic representations of a given story, is not the only conceivable relationship between poetry and art in Archaic and Early Classical Greece. The empirical evidence advanced to support the belief, the occurrence of similar motifs in both the poetic sources and the visual representations, is strained: scholars have read into the pictures motifs or intentions, including nudity and seduction, that are known from literature but have not been given unambiguous visual form in the pictures. This paper argues that the relationship between the artistic and literary representations of the recovery of Helen is much more distant and less direct than most scholars have thought. The same general story underlies all the pictorial representations of the subject in the Archaic and Early Classical periods, but no specific poetic source was necessarily behind the story circulating among the artists. This study draws attention, in particular, to methods of storytelling that are unique to the visual arts. It addresses in detail one of the most striking and problematic aspects of the iconography of the recovery of Helen, the variety of physical settings of the event, and argues that the pictorial elements of setting provide important narrative information that verbal narratives would convey in a different way.},

Physical exercise shows antidepressive effects and may serve as an effective augmentation treatment. However, research on combining exercise with CBT is sparse in MDD and underlying mechanisms of exercise are not well understood to date. Methods 120 outpatients with MDD were randomized to either a high intensity exercise group (HEX), a low intensity exercise group (LEX), or a waiting list control group (WL). After 12~weeks of exercise training or waiting period, all patients received a manualized CBT. Results Seventy-five patients with MDD completed both the exercise program/ waiting period and the CBT. While physical fitness improved in HEX after the exercise program, it did not change in LEX and WL. Depressive symptoms improved in all three groups from baseline to post-CBT and the group by time interaction was not significant. Regression analyses revealed that the amount of fitness improvement during exercise predicted the subsequent CBT response. Limitations The dropout rate was relatively high, preparatory CBT sessions during exercise / waiting period may have influenced depressive symptoms, and no patients with severe MDD were included. Conclusions High intense physical exercise did not lead to a general enhancement of CBT outcome, but higher increases in physical fitness seem to improve symptom change during CBT. Our results suggest that the implementation of more individually tailored exercise programs could be a promising approach for future research and clinical practice.},

Since first published in 1984, it has been used in over 40 countries within universities, medical schools and nursing colleges. This new edition meets the ever-growing need for a clear starting point in understanding the clinical significance of cultural and social factors. The book addresses the complex interactions between health, illness and culture by setting out anthropological theory in a highly readable, jargon-free style and integrating this with the practice of health care using real-life examples and case histories.Fully revised throughout, the fifth edition has expanded its coverage of topics that are challenging both the patient and the carer's understanding of health and illness: poverty and inequality of healthcare, genetics, biotechnology, the internet and health, chronic diseases, drug-resistant infections, changes in nutrition and body image, medical care of migrants, medical technology, global pandemics such as AIDS and malaria, drug and alcohol dependence, and patients' 'languages of distress', a complex topic central to the doctor-patient relationship.In today's world of increasing cultural, religious and ethnic diversity of populations, Culture, Health and Illness is essential reading for students of medicine, nursing, psychiatry, public health, health education, international health and medical anthropology, across the globe.},

Methods We conducted a systematic review of four databases to identify studies empirically assessing sample sizes for saturation in qualitative research, supplemented by searching citing articles and reference lists. Results We identified 23 articles that used empirical data (n~=~17) or statistical modeling (n~=~6) to assess saturation. Studies using empirical data reached saturation within a narrow range of interviews (9\textendash 17) or focus group discussions (4\textendash 8), particularly those with relatively homogenous study populations and narrowly defined objectives. Most studies had a relatively homogenous study population and assessed code saturation; the few outliers (e.g., multi-country research, meta-themes, ``code meaning'' saturation) needed larger samples for saturation. Conclusions Despite varied research topics and approaches to assessing saturation, studies converged on a relatively consistent sample size for saturation for commonly used qualitative research methods. However, these findings apply to certain types of studies (e.g., those with homogenous study populations). These results provide strong empirical guidance on effective sample sizes for qualitative research, which can be used in conjunction with the characteristics of individual studies to estimate an appropriate sample size prior to data collection. This synthesis also provides an important resource for researchers, academic journals, journal reviewers, ethical review boards, and funding agencies to facilitate greater transparency in justifying and reporting sample sizes in qualitative research. Future empirical research is needed to explore how various parameters affect sample sizes for saturation.},

  abstract = {This paper advances an ``information goods'' theory that explains prestige processes as an emergent product of psychological adaptations that evolved to improve the quality of information acquired via cultural transmission. Natural selection favored social learners who could evaluate potential models and copy the most successful among them. In order to improve the fidelity and comprehensiveness of such ranked-biased copying, social learners further evolved dispositions to sycophantically ingratiate themselves with their chosen models, so as to gain close proximity to, and prolonged interaction with, these models. Once common, these dispositions created, at the group level, distributions of deference that new entrants may adaptively exploit to decide who to begin copying. This generated a preference for models who seem generally ``popular.'' Building on social exchange theories, we argue that a wider range of phenomena associated with prestige processes can more plausibly be explained by this simple theory than by others, and we test its predictions with data from throughout the social sciences. In addition, we distinguish carefully between dominance (force or force threat) and prestige (freely conferred deference).},

  abstract = {A combination of archeological and ethnohistorical evidence indicates that, over an approximately 8,000-year period, from the beginning of the Holocene until European explorers began arriving in the eighteenth century, the societies of Tasmania lost a series of valuable skills and technologies. These likely included bone tools, cold-weather clothing, hafted tools, nets, fishing spears, barbed spears, spear-throwers, and boomerangs. To address this puzzle, and the more general question of how human cognition and social interaction can generate both adaptive cultural evolution and maladaptive losses of culturally acquired skills, this paper constructs a formal model of cultural evolution rooted in the cognitive details of human social learning and inference. The analytical results specify the conditions for differing rates of adaptive cultural evolution, and reveal regimes that will produce maladaptive losses of particular kinds of skills and related technologies. More specifically, the results suggest that the relatively sudden reduction in the effective population size (the size of the interacting pool of social learners) that occurred with the rising ocean levels at the end of the last glacial epoch, which cut Tasmania off from the rest of Australia for the ensuing ten millennia, could have initiated a cultural evolutionary process that (1) kept stable or even improved relatively simple technological skills, and (2) produced an increasing deterioration of more complex skills leading to the complete disappearance of some technologies and practices. This pattern is consistent with the empirical record in Tasmania. Beyond this case, I speculate on the applicability of the model to understanding the variability in rates of adaptive cultural evolution. /// La evidencia arqueol\'ogica y etnohist\'orica indica que, a lo largo de aproximadamente 8,000 anos, desde elprincipio del Holoceno hasta la llegada de exploradores europeos en el sigh XVIII, las sociedades de Tasmania perdieron gran parte de su cultura tecnol\'ogica. Las herramientas que desaparecieronprobablemente incluyen el hueso, ropa resistente al fr\'io, los instrumentos enmangados, arpones, lanzas de p\'uas, los lanza-lanzadores y los bumerangs. \textquestiondown C\'omo es posible que se perdiera todo esto? Para resolver este misterio, y tambi\'en esclarecer deforma m\'as general c\'omo el conocimiento humano y la interacci\'on social pueden generar adaptaciones y tambi\'en la p\'erdida de las mismas, e inclusive malas adaptaciones, en este articulo se construye un modelo formai de la evoluci\'on cultural que se basa en detalles cognoscitivos del aprendizaje y la inferencia humanos en el \'ambito social. Los resultados anal\'iticos especifican los reg\'imenes de condiciones bajo los cuales la evoluci\'on cultural genera adaptaciones, y tambi\'en los reg\'imenes contrastantes bajo los cuales seproducen p\'erdidas que representan malas adapta ciones tanto de habilidades como de las tecnolog\'ias vinculadas con ellas. M\'as especificamente, los resultados sugieren que la reducci\'on relativamente repentina en el tama\~no eficaz de la poblaci\^on (el tama\~no del grupo de aprendices sociales), es la causa m\'as importante de estas p\'erdidas culturales. El motor ecol\'ogico de esta reducci\^on fue el alza del nivel del mar en la \'epoca final de la glaciaci\'on pasada, que tuvo como efecto separar a Tasmania del resto de Australia durante los \'ultimos diez milenios. La consecuencia fue un deterioro de las habilidades m\'as complejas con las cuales contaba esta poblaci\'on. El expediente empir\'ico de la arqueolog\'ia en Tasmania confirma este patr\'on. M\'as all\'a de este caso particular, se presentan especulaciones acerca de la aplicabilidad de este modelo para entender la variabilidad en los \'indices de la evoluci\'on cultural adaptativa en el marco tecnol\'ogico.},

  abstract = {Behavioral scientists routinely publish broad claims about human psychology and behavior in the world's top journals based on samples drawn entirely from Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) societies. Researchers \textendash{} often implicitly \textendash{} assume that either there is little variation across human populations, or that these ``standard subjects'' are as representative of the species as any other population. Are these assumptions justified? Here, our review of the comparative database from across the behavioral sciences suggests both that there is substantial variability in experimental results across populations and that WEIRD subjects are particularly unusual compared with the rest of the species \textendash{} frequent outliers. The domains reviewed include visual perception, fairness, cooperation, spatial reasoning, categorization and inferential induction, moral reasoning, reasoning styles, self-concepts and related motivations, and the heritability of IQ. The findings suggest that members of WEIRD societies, including young children, are among the least representative populations one could find for generalizing about humans. Many of these findings involve domains that are associated with fundamental aspects of psychology, motivation, and behavior \textendash{} hence, there are no obvious a priori grounds for claiming that a particular behavioral phenomenon is universal based on sampling from a single subpopulation. Overall, these empirical patterns suggests that we need to be less cavalier in addressing questions of human nature on the basis of data drawn from this particularly thin, and rather unusual, slice of humanity. We close by proposing ways to structurally re-organize the behavioral sciences to best tackle these challenges.},

We review the major evolutionary mechanisms that have been proposed to explain human cooperation, including kinship, reciprocity (partner choice), reputation, signaling and punishment, discuss key culture-gene coevolutionary hypotheses, such as those surrounding self-domestication and norm psychology, and consider the role of religions, rituals and marriage systems. Empirically, we bring together diverse experimental, observational, and anthropological evidence from studies of children and adults from diverse societies as well as from non-human primates.},

These formed the basis for the equations used in 1985 FAO/WHO/UNU document, Energy and Protein Requirements. While Schofield's analysis has served a significant role in re-establishing the importance of using basal metabolic rate (BMR) to predict human energy requirements, recent workers have subsequently queried the universal validity and application of these equations. A survey of the most recent studies (1980-2000) in BMR suggests that in most cases the current FAO/WHO/UNU predictive equations overestimate BMR in many communities. The FAO/WHO/UNU equations to predict BMR were developed using a database that contained a disproportionate number--3388 out of 7173 (47\%)--of Italian subjects. The Schofield database contained relatively few subjects from the tropical region. The objective here is to review the historical development in the measurement and application of BMR and to critically review the Schofield et al. BMR database presenting a series of new equations to predict BMR. This division, while arbitrary, will enable readers who wish to omit the historical review of BMR to concentrate on the evolution of the new BMR equations. BMR data collected from published and measured values. A series of new equations (Oxford equations) have been developed using a data set of 10,552 BMR values that (1) excluded all the Italian subjects and (2) included a much larger number (4018) of people from the tropics. In general, the Oxford equations tend to produce lower BMR values than the current FAO/WHO/UNU equations in 18-30 and 30-60 year old males and in all females over 18 years of age. This is an opportune moment to re-examine the role and place of BMR measurements in estimating total energy requirements today. The Oxford equations' future use and application will surely depend on their ability to predict more accurately the BMR in contemporary populations.},

Currently, there is a dearth of data on maternal mood and infant health outcomes in small-scale non-industrial populations from such countries, particularly during the postnatal period. Here, we present the first investigation of postpartum maternal mood among a foraging population, the Hadza of Tanzania. We administered the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) to twenty-three women, all with infants under the age of 12 months. Semi-structured interviews on happiness and unhappiness during the post-partum period served as a validity cross-check for the EPDS. The combined results of the EPDS surveys and the interview responses suggest that a high proportion of Hadza women experience significant mood disturbances following birth and that postpartum unhappiness is associated with self-reports of pain, anxiety, and disturbed sleep patterns. These findings suggest that many of the mothers in our sample are experiencing post-partum unhappiness at levels similar to or higher than those reported for low to middle income countries in general, including Tanzania. These data are critical for improving our understanding of the etiologies of postpartum mood disturbances cross-culturally.},

We tested this hypothesis by giving a comprehensive battery of cognitive tests to large numbers of two of humans' closest primate relatives, chimpanzees and orangutans, as well as to 2.5-year-old human children before literacy and schooling. Supporting the cultural intelligence hypothesis and contradicting the hypothesis that humans simply have more ``general intelligence,'' we found that the children and chimpanzees had very similar cognitive skills for dealing with the physical world but that the children had more sophisticated cognitive skills than either of the ape species for dealing with the social world.},

The goal of most HBE models is to predict which decision a forager might make given the desired outcome of obtaining the highest return per unit effort, the maximization of which is assumed to enhance fitness.

Controlling for anger, we found an adult female bias in indirect aggression. Physical strength predicted anger, which predicted hitting, although results were sensitive to the inclusion or exclusion of traditional healers, who were physically and emotionally distinct from other Aka.

Both of these traits and others are linked by lifehistory theory to mortality rates experienced at different ages by our hominin ancestors. However, currently there is a great deal of debate concerning hominin mortality profiles at different periods of evolutionary history. Observed rates and causes of mortality in modern hunter-gatherers may provide information about Upper Paleolithic mortality that can be compared to indirect evidence from the fossil record, yet little is published about causes and rates of mortality in foraging societies around the world. To our knowledge, interview-based life tables for recent huntergatherers are published for only four societies (Ache, Agta, Hadza, and Ju/'hoansi). Here, we present mortality data for a fifth group, the Hiwi hunter-gatherers of Venezuela. The results show comparatively high death rates among the Hiwi and highlight differences in mortality rates among hunter-gatherer societies. The high levels of conspecific violence and adult mortality in the Hiwi may better represent Paleolithic human demographics than do the lower, disease-based death rates reported in the most frequently cited forager studies.},

  abstract = {Although recent research has increasingly focused on human sexual selection, fundamental questions remain concerning the relative influence of individual traits on success in competition for mates and the mechanisms, form, and direction of these sexual selective pressures. Here, we explore sexual selection on men's traits by ascertaining men's dominance and attractiveness from male and female acquaintances. On a large American university campus, 63 men from two social fraternities provided anthropometric measurements, facial photographs, voice recordings, and reported mating success (number of sexual partners). These men also assessed each other's dominance, and 72 women from two socially affiliated sororities assessed the men's attractiveness. We measured facial masculinity from inter-landmark distances and vocal masculinity from acoustic parameters. We additionally obtained facial and vocal attractiveness and dominance ratings from unfamiliar observers. Results indicate that dominance and the traits associated with it predict men's mating success, but attractiveness and the traits associated with it do not. These findings point to the salience of contest competition on men's mating success in this population.},

  abstract = {Our species exhibits spectacular success due to cumulative culture. While cognitive evolution of social learning mechanisms may be partially responsible for adaptive human culture, features of early human social structure may also play a role by increasing the number potential models from which to learn innovations. We present interview data on interactions between same-sex adult dyads of Ache and Hadza hunter-gatherers living in multiple distinct residential bands (20 Ache bands; 42 Hadza bands; 1201 dyads) throughout a tribal home range. Results show high probabilities (5\%\textendash 29\% per year) of cultural and cooperative interactions between randomly chosen adults. Multiple regression suggests that ritual relationships increase interaction rates more than kinship, and that affinal kin interact more often than dyads with no relationship. These may be important features of human sociality. Finally, yearly interaction rates along with survival data allow us to estimate expected lifetime partners for a variety of social activities, and compare those to chimpanzees. Hadza and Ache men are estimated to observe over 300 men making tools in a lifetime, whereas male chimpanzees interact with only about 20 other males in a lifetime. High intergroup interaction rates in ancestral humans may have promoted the evolution of cumulative culture.},

It is, therefore, surprising that a theory comprised by three internal factors only is so uncritically embraced by suicide researchers.

In the domain of emotion, expertise refers to the observation that some people are better at a range of competencies related to understanding and experiencing emotions, and these competencies may help them lead healthier lives. These individual differences are represented by multiple constructs including emotional awareness, emotional clarity, emotional complexity, emotional granularity, and emotional intelligence. These constructs derive from different theoretical perspectives, highlight different competencies, and are operationalized and measured in different ways. The full set of relationships between these constructs has not yet been considered, hindering scientific progress and the translation of findings to aid mental and physical well-being. In this paper, we use a scoping review procedure to integrate these constructs within a shared conceptual space. Scoping reviews provide a principled means of synthesizing large and diverse literatures in a transparent fashion, enabling the identification of similarities as well as gaps and inconsistencies across constructs. Using domain-general accounts of expertise as a guide, we build a unifying framework for expertise in emotion and apply this to constructs that describe how people understand and experience their own emotions. Our approach offers opportunities to identify potential mechanisms of expertise in emotion, encouraging future research on those mechanisms and on educational or clinical interventions.},

  abstract = {Background Whether there are systematic differences in depression symptom expression during pregnancy, the postpartum period and outside these periods (i.e., outside the peripartum period) remains debated. The aim of this study was to use methods based on item response theory (IRT) to examine, after equating for depression severity, differences in the likelihood of reporting DSM-IV symptoms of major depressive episode (MDE) in women of childbearing age (i.e., aged 18-50) during pregnancy, the postpartum period and outside the peripartum period. Method We conducted these analyses using a large, nationally representative sample of women of childbearing age from the USA (n = 11,256) who participated in the second wave of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC). Results The overall 12-month prevalence of all depressive criteria (except for worthlessness/guilt) was significantly lower in pregnant women than in women of childbearing age outside the peripartum period, whereas the prevalence of all symptoms (except for ``psychomotor symptoms'') were not significantly different between the postpartum and the non-peripartum group. There were no clinically significant differences in the endorsement rates of symptoms of MDE by pregnancy status when equating for levels of depression severity. Conclusions This study suggests that the clinical presentation of depressive symptoms in women of childbearing age does not differ during pregnancy, the postpartum period and outside the peripartum period. These findings do not provide psychometric support for the inclusion of the peripartum onset specifier for major depressive disorder in the DSM-5.},

Human social relationships\textemdash including support from extended family, cooperative pair-bonds between men and women, biparental care, and extensive cooperation between non-relatives\textemdash are likewise features that set humans apart from many other primates and mammals (Lancaster and Lancaster, 1983; Hill et al., 2009; Hrdy, 2009; Jaeggi and Gurven, 2013). It is increasingly clear that patterns of human demography and sociality are interdependent and mutually reinforcing, making it likely that they co-evolved during humans' evolutionary history. In this paper, we present a framework for investigating the relevant causal links between ecology, social structure, and biodemography that are essential to explaining the unique evolutionary trajectory of the species. This framework aims to explain both humans' unique demographic and social characteristics relative to other taxa, as well as variation in these characteristics within and across human societies.},

Integrating these models with Hamilton's theory of inclusive fitness, we predict that the interaction of biological kinship with the age-schedule of resource production should be a key driver of intergenerational transfers. In the empirical case of Tsimane' forager\textendash horticulturalists in Bolivian Amazonia, we provide a detailed characterization of net transfers of food according to age, sex, kinship and the net need of donors and recipients. We show that parents, grandparents and siblings provide significant net downward transfers of food across generations. We demonstrate that the extent of provisioning responds facultatively to variation in the productivity and demographic composition of families, as predicted by the theory. We hypothesize that the motivation to provide these critical transfers is a fundamental force that binds together human nuclear and extended families. The ubiquity of three-generational families in human societies may thus be a direct reflection of fundamental evolutionary constraints on an organism's life-history and social organization.},

The size and composition of cooperative groups can be understood as a self-organized outcome of these choices, which are made under local ecological and social constraints. This article describes a theoretical framework for explaining the size and composition of foraging groups based on three principles: (i) the sexual division of labour; (ii) the intergenerational division of labour; and (iii) economies of scale in production. We test predictions from the theory with data from two field contexts: Tsimane' game hunters of lowland Bolivia, and Jenu Kuruba honey collectors of South India. In each case, we estimate the impacts of group size and individual group members' effort on group success. We characterize differences in the skill requirements of different foraging activities and show that individuals participate more frequently in activities in which they are more efficient. We evaluate returns to scale across different resource types and observe higher returns at larger group sizes in foraging activities (such as hunting large game) that benefit from coordinated and complementary roles. These results inform us that the foraging group size and composition are guided by the motivated choice of individuals on the basis of relative efficiency, benefits of cooperation, opportunity costs and other social considerations.},

The aim of this study is to empirically evaluate that characterization. We survey anthropologists in graduate programs in the United States regarding their views of science and advocacy, moral and epistemic relativism, and the merits of evolutionary biological explanations. We examine anthropologists' views in concert with their varying appraisals of major controversies in the discipline (Chagnon/Tierney, Mead/Freeman, and Mench\'u/Stoll). We find that disciplinary specialization and especially gender and political orientation are significant predictors of anthropologists' views. We interpret our findings through the lens of an intuitionist social psychology that helps explain the dynamics of such controversies as well as ongoing ideological divisions in the field.},

  abstract = {Depression has become the single most commonly treated mental disorder, amid claims that one out of ten Americans suffer from this disorder every year and 25\% succumb at some point in their lives. Warnings that depressive disorder is a leading cause of worldwide disability have been accompanied by a massive upsurge in the consumption of antidepressant medication, widespread screening for depression in clinics and schools, and a push to diagnose depression early, on the basis of just a few symptoms, in order to prevent more severe conditions from developing. In The Loss of Sadness, Allan V. Horwitz and Jerome C. Wakefield argue that, while depressive disorder certainly exists and can be a devastating condition warranting medical attention, the apparent epidemic in fact reflects the way the psychiatric profession has understood and reclassified normal human sadness as largely an abnormal experience. With the 1980 publication of the landmark third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III), mental health professionals began diagnosing depression based on symptoms--such as depressed mood, loss of appetite, and fatigue--that lasted for at least two weeks. This system is fundamentally flawed, the authors maintain, because it fails to take into account the context in which the symptoms occur. They stress the importance of distinguishing between abnormal reactions due to internal dysfunction and normal sadness brought on by external circumstances. Under the current DSM classification system, however, this distinction is impossible to make, so the expected emotional distress caused by upsetting events-for example, the loss of a job or the end of a relationship- could lead to a mistaken diagnosis of depressive disorder. Indeed, it is this very mistake that lies at the root of the presumed epidemic of major depression in our midst. In telling the story behind this phenomenon, the authors draw on the 2,500-year history of writing about depression, including studies in both the medical and social sciences, to demonstrate why the DSM's diagnosis is so flawed. They also explore why it has achieved almost unshakable currency despite its limitations. Framed within an evolutionary account of human health and disease, The Loss of Sadness presents a fascinating dissection of depression as both a normal and disordered human emotion and a sweeping critique of current psychiatric diagnostic practices. The result is a potent challenge to the diagnostic revolution that began almost thirty years ago in psychiatry and a provocative analysis of one of the most significant mental health issues today.},

But awakened one morning by the crackle of musket fire, Horwitz starts filing front-line dispatches again this time from a war close to home, and to his own heart.Propelled by his boyhood passion for the Civil War, Horwitz embarks on a search for places and people still held in thrall by America's greatest conflict. The result is an adventure into the soul of the unvanquished South, where the ghosts of the Lost Cause are resurrected through ritual and remembrance.In Virginia, Horwitz joins a band of 'hardcore' reenactors who crash-diet to achieve the hollow-eyed look of starved Confederates; in Kentucky, he witnesses Klan rallies and calls for race war sparked by the killing of a white man who brandishes a rebel flag; at Andersonville, he finds that the prison's commander, executed as a war criminal, is now exalted as a martyr and hero; and in the book's climax, Horwitz takes a marathon trek from Antietam to Gettysburg to Appomattox in the company of Robert Lee Hodge, an eccentric pilgrim who dubs their odyssey the 'Civil Wargasm.'Written with Horwitz's signature blend of humor, history, and hard-nosed journalism, Confederates in the Attic brings alive old battlefields and the new 'classrooms, courts, country bars' where the past and the present collide, often in explosive ways.~Tony Horwitz's new book,~Spying on the South: An Odyssey Across the American Divide, is available~now.},

The CRE reveals systematic limitations on eyewitness identification accuracy, suggesting that some caution is warranted in evaluating cross-race identification. The CRE is problematic because jurors value eyewitness identification highly in verdict decisions. We explore how accurate people are in predicting their ability to recognize own-race and other-race faces. Caucasian and Asian participants viewed photographs of Caucasian and Asian faces, and made immediate judgments of learning during study. An old/new recognition test replicated the CRE: both groups displayed superior discriminability of own-race faces. Importantly, relative metamnemonic accuracy was also greater for own-race faces, indicating that the accuracy of predictions about face recognition is influenced by race. This result indicates another source of concern when eliciting or evaluating eyewitness identification: people are less accurate in judging whether they will or will not recognize a face when that face is of a different race than they are. This new result suggests that a witness's claim of being likely to recognize a suspect from a lineup should be interpreted with caution when the suspect is of a different race than the witness.},

The persistence of this widespread practice also presents a puzzle for evolutionary anthropologists due to its potentially detrimental impact on survival and reproductive fitness. Using multilevel modelling on Demographic Health Survey (DHS) datasets from 5 West African countries, here we show that FGC behaviour is frequencydependent; the probability that girls are cut varies in proportion to the FGC frequency found in their ethnic group. We also show that this frequency-dependent behaviour is adaptive in evolutionary fitness terms; in ethnic groups with high FGC frequency women with FGC have significantly more surviving offspring than their uncut peers and the reverse is found in ethnic groups with low FGC frequency. Our results demonstrate how evolutionary and cultural forces can drive the persistence of harmful behaviours.},

  abstract = {,  Intimate partner violence (IPV) refers to physical, sexual and psychological violence. Here an evolutionary approach is used to compare risk factors for male-to-female IPV perpetration, analysing physical and sexual IPV separately. Two hypotheses based on sexual conflict theory have been applied to IPV perpetration, but they remain largely untested using empirical data: (a) men perpetrate IPV in response to a perceived threat to their paternity certainty; and (b) IPV is caused by men pursuing a higher fertility optima than their partners, either within marriage (reproductive coercion) or outside marriage (paternal disinvestment). Demographic Health Survey data from couples in 12 sub-Saharan African countries (n = 25,577) were used to test these evolutionary hypotheses, using multilevel models and controlling for potential social and environmental confounds. The results show that evolutionary theory provides important insight into different risk factors by IPV type. Indicators of paternity concern are associated with an increased risk of both physical and sexual IPV, indicators of paternal disinvestment are associated with an increased risk of physical IPV only, while reproductive coercion is not associated with either IPV type. The risk factors identified here correspond with proximate-level explanations for IPV perpetration, but an evolutionary interpretation explains why these particular factors may motivate IPV in certain contexts.},

Conducted with subsistence resource users in rural villages on the Kamchatka Peninsula in Northeast Siberia, we find evidence consistent with a model of indirect reciprocity and local social norms of helping the needy. When participants are allowed to develop reputations in the experiments, as is the case in most small-scale societies, we find that sharing is increasingly directed toward individuals experiencing hardship, good reputations increase aid, and the pooling of resources through voluntary sharing becomes more effective. We also find high levels of voluntary sharing without a strong commitment device; however, this form of cooperation does not increase contributions to the public good. Our results are consistent with previous experiments and theoretical models, suggesting strategic risks tied to rewards, punishments, and reputations are important. However, unlike studies that focus solely on strategic risks, we find the effects of rewards, punishments, and reputations are altered by the presence of environmental factors. Unexpected changes in resource abundance increase interdependence and may alter the costs and benefits of cooperation, relative to defection. We suggest environmental factors that increase interdependence are critically important to consider when developing and testing theories of cooperation},

Methods:~         Systematic review of articles published between January 1967 and January 2008 in the PubMed and PsycINFO electronic databases was performed. Effect sizes were calculated as stat d and meta-analyzed, using random-effects models.         Results:~         Each inflammatory marker was positively associated with depression; CRP, d = 0.15 (95\% CI = 0.10, 0.21), p {$<$} .001; IL-6, d = 0.25 (95\% CI = 0.18, 0.31), p {$<$} .001; IL-1, d = 0.35 (95\% CI = 0.03, 0.67), p = .03; IL-1ra, d = 0.25 (95\% CI = 0.04, 0.46), p = .02. Associations were strongest in clinically depressed patient samples\textemdash but were also significant in community-based samples\textemdash and when clinical interviews were used. Studies adjusting for body mass index (BMI) had smaller associations, albeit significant. Relationships were inconsistent with respect to age, medication, and sex. Depression was related to CRP and IL-6 among patients with cardiac disease or cancer.         Conclusions:~         Depression and CRP, IL-1, and IL-6 are positively associated in clinical and community samples and BMI is implicated as a mediating/moderating factor. Continuity in clinic- and community-based samples suggests there is a dose-response relationship between depression and these inflammatory markers, lending strength to the contention that the cardiac (or cancer) risk conferred by depression is not exclusive to patient populations. Available evidence is consistent with three causal pathways: depression to inflammation, inflammation to depression, and bidirectional relationships.

Mother Nature presents a radical new way of understanding how mothers act and why, and how this new understanding is changing the way scientists think about how evolution works. Drawing on anthropology, history, literature, developmental psychology, and animal behavior, Sarah Hrdy examines the distinct biological and genetic elements that constitute maternal instinct. She strips away the biases implicit in conventional stereotypes of female nature to give us very different and provocative perspectives on maternal ambivalence, the links between maturity and ambition, mother love and sexual love, and why age-old tensions between the sexes persist--and are being played out today in efforts to control women's reproductive choices. Combining decades of research with her own experience as a mother, Hrdy makes clear in this remarkable book what it means--from a historical and evolutionary perspective--to be a mother and explains how this knowledge has transformed our understanding of human development and behavior.},

The list of diseases in which cannabinoids are promoted as a treatment is constantly expanding. Cases of significant improvement in patients with a very poor prognosis of glioma or epilepsy have already been described. However, the occurrence of side effects is still difficult to estimate, and the current knowledge of the therapeutic effects of cannabinoids is still insufficient. In our opinion, the answers to many questions and concerns regarding the medical use of cannabis can be provided by pharmacogenetics. Knowledge based on proteins and molecules involved in the transport, action, and metabolism of cannabinoids in the human organism leads us to predict candidate genes which variations are responsible for the presence of the therapeutic and side effects of medical marijuana and cannabinoid-based drugs. We can divide them into: receptor genes\textemdash CNR1, CNR2, TRPV1, and GPR55, transporters\textemdash ABCB1, ABCG2, SLC6A, biotransformation, biosynthesis, and bioactivation proteins encoded by CYP3A4, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2A6, CYP1A1, COMT, FAAH, COX2, ABHD6, ABHD12 genes, and also MAPK14.

  abstract = {Long considered one of the technical masterpieces of Archaic Greek vase painting, the Protocorinthian Chigi vase (ca. 640 B.C.) has defied attempts at interpretation. Its imagery has most often been understood as a random assortment of exquisite but unrelated scenes-hunts, horsemanship, the Judgment of Paris, and a hoplite battle. It is argued here that there is in fact a logic behind the choice of scenes, and that the vase displays a pliable thematic unity, focusing upon the stages of maturation of the Corinthian male and the interpenetration of the everyday, the exotic, the heroic, and the divine in the lives of mortals.},

This is a complex ethical and moral issue; in some states such as California, Colorado, Kentucky, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and New Mexico it has become a legal one as well. The Federal health privacy regulation instituted in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) addresses issues of privacy protection for survivors of domestic violence, but it does not preempt those state laws that are less (or more) protective of patient privacy. In the above states, physicians and/or health care providers are mandated to report acts of domestic violence to an agency, under their own circumstances, regardless of whether the physician or health care worker believes that reporting the violence is in the patient's best interest or not. But is mandatory reporting truly "good" or "bad" for the patient, the physician or society as a whole? This article explores the laws and the evidence (including evidence-based research) surrounding the issue of mandatory reporting of domestic violence when it pertains to a competent adult.}

  abstract = {Many studies investigate the benefits of polyandry, but repeated interactions with males can lower female reproductive success. Interacting with males might even decrease offspring performance if it reduces a female's ability to transfer maternal resources. Male presence can be detrimental for females in two ways: by forcing females to mate at a higher rate and through costs associated with resisting male mating attempts. Teasing apart the relative costs of elevated mating rates from those of greater male harassment is critical to understand the evolution of mating strategies. Furthermore, it is important to test whether a male's phenotype, notably body size, has differential effects on female reproductive success versus the performance of offspring, and whether this is due to male body size affecting the costs of harassment or the actual mating rate. In the eastern mosquitofish Gambusia holbrooki, males vary greatly in body size and continually attempt to inseminate females. We experimentally manipulated male presence (i.e., harassment), male body size and whether males could copulate. Exposure to males had strong detrimental effects on female reproductive output, growth and immune response, independent of male size or whether males could copulate. In contrast, there was a little evidence of a cross-generational effect of male harassment or mating rate on offspring performance. Our results suggest that females housed with males pay direct costs due to reduced condition and offspring production and that these costs are not a consequence of increased mating rates. Furthermore, exposure to males does not affect offspring reproductive traits.},

  abstract = {Summary There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

  abstract = {Background and objectives Intimate partner violence (IPV) around the time of pregnancy is a serious public health concern and is known to have an adverse effect on perinatal mental health. In order to craft appropriate and effective interventions, it is important to understand how the association between IPV and postpartum depression (PPD) may differ as a function of the type and timing of IPV victimization. Here we evaluate the influence of physical, sexual and psychological IPV before, during and after pregnancy on PPD. Methods Cross-sectional survey data was collected between October 2015 and January 2016 in the Chandpur District of Bangladesh from 426 new mothers, aged 15\textendash 49 years, who were in the first six months postpartum. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to estimate the association between IPV and PPD, adjusted for socio-demographic, reproductive and psychosocial confounding factors. Results Approximately 35.2\% of women experienced PPD within the first six months following childbirth. Controlling for confounders, the odds of PPD was significantly greater among women who reported exposure to physical (AOR: 1.79, 95\% CI [1.25, 3.43]), sexual (AOR: 2.25, 95\% CI [1.14, 4.45]) or psychological (AOR: 6.92, 95\% CI [1.71, 28.04]) IPV during pregnancy as opposed to those who did not. However, both before and after pregnancy, only physical IPV evidences a direct effect on PPD. Results highlight the mental health consequences of IPV for women of Bangladesh, as well as the influence of timing and type of IPV on PPD outcomes. Conclusions and implications The findings confirm that exposure to IPV significantly increases the odds of PPD. The association is particularly strong for physical IPV during all periods and psychological IPV during pregnancy. Results reinforce the need to conduct routine screening during pregnancy to identify women with a history of IPV who may at risk for PPD and to offer them necessary support.},

  abstract = {Helping, i.e. behaviour increasing the fitness of others, can evolve when directed towards kin or reciprocating partners. These predictions have been tested in the context of food sharing both in human foragers and non-human primates. Here, we performed quantitative meta-analyses on 32 independent study populations to (i) test for overall effects of reciprocity on food sharing while controlling for alternative explanations, methodological biases, publication bias and phylogeny and (ii) compare the relative effects of reciprocity, kinship and tolerated scrounging, i.e. sharing owing to costs imposed by others. We found a significant overall weighted effect size for reciprocity of               r               = 0.20\textendash 0.48 for the most and least conservative measure, respectively. Effect sizes did not differ between humans and other primates, although there were species differences in in-kind reciprocity and trade. The relative effect of reciprocity in sharing was similar to those of kinship and tolerated scrounging. These results indicate a significant independent contribution of reciprocity to human and primate helping behaviour. Furthermore, similar effect sizes in humans and primates speak against cognitive constraints on reciprocity. This study is the first to use meta-analyses to quantify these effects on human helping and to directly compare humans and other primates.},

We therefore emphasize the need to tie discussions of human cooperation to the natural history of our species and its closest relatives, focusing on behavioral contexts best suited to reveal underlying selection pressures and evolved decision rules. Food sharing is a fundamental form of cooperation that is well-studied across primates and is particularly noteworthy because of its central role in shaping evolved human life history, social organization, and cooperative psychology. Here we synthesize available evidence on food sharing in humans and other primates, tracing the origins of offspring provisioning, mutualism, trade, and reciprocity throughout the primate order. While primates may gain some benefits from sharing, humans, faced with more collective action problems in a risky foraging niche, expanded on primate patterns to buffer risk and recruit mates and allies through reciprocity and signaling, and established co-evolving social norms of production and sharing. Differences in the necessity for sharing are reflected in differences in sharing psychology across species, thus helping to explain unique aspects of our evolved cooperative psychology.},

Relative wealth and inequality were associated with self-rated health and morbidity, especially respiratory disease, the leading cause of mortality in the Tsimane. Inequality was also associated with higher blood pressure. However, psychosocial stress did not mediate these associations, suggesting other mechanisms.

  abstract = {This article discusses key work on the development of the Stockholm syndrome as a psychological explanation for the development of a bond between hostage-taker and hostage in hijack and siege situations. Within this work, the Stockholm syndrome is explained in part as an unconscious identification, but is also regarded as a conscious coping strategy which can be understood as a form of adaptive behaviour, providing hope for the victim in an otherwise hopeless situation. The author links these paradoxical accounts of intersubjectivity with recent genealogies of trauma, panic disorder and hypnotism which argue that the development of the former is characterized by a tension between accounts of the subject as autonomous and those which imply that the subject's capacity to merge with or depend upon the other is constitutive of subjectivity. The article engages with recent perspectives associated with the ``turn to affect'' which posit openness to affect as intrinsically hopeful. The author argues that notions of openness to affect have historically been aligned with hierarchical models which produce some subjects as more susceptible to influence. In conclusion, the article draws on contemporary theories which posit trauma as a mode of collective memory. The author argues that the Stockholm syndrome relies in part for its intelligibility on a particular reading of the violent and traumatic social situations from which it emerged, one which disavows a longer history of violence between the Western ``victim'' and the post-colonial other. Finally, the author suggests that the Stockholm syndrome calls up the possibility of modes of empathy and connection which enable a reconsideration of how the development of bonds between people in traumatic contexts can be understood as hopeful.},

  abstract = {Background Marijuana is the most commonly used illicit substance in pregnancy. Little is known about how pregnant women who use marijuana obtain and understand information about perinatal marijuana use. We conducted a qualitative study among pregnant women who had used marijuana to understand their information-seeking patterns and perceptions of usefulness of available information about perinatal marijuana use. Study Design We conducted semistructured interviews with 26 pregnant women who were receiving prenatal care and who either disclosed marijuana use or had urine samples testing positive for marijuana. Interviews assessed women's sources of information about risks of perinatal marijuana use and perceptions regarding the usefulness of such information. Interview data were coded independently by two coders who iteratively refined the codes and reviewed transcripts for themes. Results Commonly reported sources of information about perinatal marijuana use included Internet searching and anecdotal experiences or advice from family or friends. Few women reported receiving helpful information from a health care provider or social worker. Women perceived a lack of evidence about harms of perinatal marijuana use, and reported being dissatisfied with the quality of information. Most women said they desired information about the effects of perinatal marijuana use on infant health. Conclusions Women who used marijuana before or during pregnancy did not find available information about perinatal marijuana use to be useful, and sought more information pertaining to infant health and well-being. Efforts to reduce perinatal marijuana use should focus on addressing this need in both clinical and public health settings.},

  abstract = {"With fine-tuned ethnographic sensibility, Jenkins explores the lived experience of psychosis, trauma, and depression among people of diverse cultural orientations, eloquently showing how mental illness engages fundamental human processes of self, desire, gender, identity, attachment, and meaning. Her studies illustrate the shaping of human reality and subjectivity in light of extreme psychological suffering, and shed light on psycho-political processes of alterity, precarity, and repression in the social rendering of the mentally ill as non-human or less than fully human. Extraordinary Conditions addresses the critical need to empathically engage the experience of persons living with conditions that are culturally defined as mental illness. Jenkins compellingly shows that mental illness is better characterized in terms of struggle than symptoms and that culture matters vitally in all aspects of mental illness from onset to recovery. Analysis at this edge of experience refashions the boundaries between ordinary and extraordinary, routine and extreme, healthy and pathological. The book argues that the study of mental illness is indispensable to anthropological understanding of culture and experience, and reciprocally that understanding culture and experience is critical to the study of mental illness. While anthropology neglects the extraordinary to its theoretical and empirical peril, psychiatry neglects culture to its theoretical and clinical peril"--Provided by publisher.},

Determination of the clinical significance of potential ADHD + internalizing disorder or ADHD + ODD/CD syndromes could yield better diagnostic decision-making, treatment planning, and treatment outcomes. Method: Drawing upon cross-sectional and longitudinal information from 579 children (aged 7\textendash 9.9 years) with ADHD participating in the NIMH Collaborative Multisite Multimodal Treatment Study of Children With Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (MTA), investigators applied validational criteria to compare ADHD subjects with and without comorbid internalizing disorders and ODD/CD. Results: Substantial evidence of main effects of internalizing and externalizing comorbid disorders was found. Moderate evidence of interactions of parent-reported anxiety and ODD/CD status were noted on response to treatment, indicating that children with ADHD and anxiety disorders (but no ODD/CD) were likely to respond equally well to the MTA behavioral and medication treatments. Children with ADHD-only or ADHD with ODD/CD (but without anxiety disorders) responded best to MTA medication treatments (with or without behavioral treatments), while children with multiple comorbid disorders (anxiety and ODD/CD) responded optimally to combined (medication and behavioral) treatments. Conclusions: Findings indicate that three clinical profiles, ADHD co-occurring with internalizing disorders (principally parent-reported anxiety disorders) absent any concurrent disruptive disorder (ADHD + ANX), ADHD co-occurring with ODD/CD but no anxiety (ADHD + ODD/CD), and ADHD with both anxiety and ODD/CD (ADHD + ANX + ODD/CD) may be sufficiently distinct to warrant classification as ADHD subtypes different from ``pure'' ADHD with neither comorbidity. Future clinical, etiological, and genetics research should explore the merits of these three ADHD classification options. J. Am. Acad. Child Adolesc. Psychiatry, 2001, 40(2):147\textendash 158.

This powerful, implicit effect overrides other opinion factors and produces broad-based support among the public for health care\textemdash across levels of self-interest, media frames, ideological divides, and national cultures.

  abstract = {Species' life histories are often classified on a continuum from ``fast'' to ``slow'', yet there is no consistently used definition of this continuum. For example, some researchers include body mass as one of the traits defining the continuum, others factor it out by analysing body-mass residuals, a third group performs both of these analyses and uses the terms ``fast'' and ``slow'' in both ways, while still others do not mention body mass at all. Our analysis of European and North American freshwater fish, mammals, and birds (N~=~2,288 species) shows the fundamental differences between life-history patterns of raw data and of body-mass residuals. Specifically, in fish and mammals, the number of traits defining the continuum decreases if body-mass residuals are analysed. In birds, the continuum is defined by a different set of traits if body mass is factored out. Our study also exposes important dissimilarities among the three taxonomic groups analysed. For example, while mammals and birds with a ``slow'' life history have a low fecundity, the opposite is true for fish. We conclude that our understanding of life histories will improve if differences between patterns of raw data and of body-mass residuals are acknowledged, as well as differences among taxonomic groups, instead of using the ``fast\textendash slow continuum'' too indiscriminately for any covarying traits that appear to suit the idea.},

  abstract = {Background Antibiotic resistance poses a great threat to global public health. Overuse of antibiotics is generally considered as the major factor contributing to it. However, little is known about whether non-antibiotic drugs could play potential roles in the emergence of antibiotic resistance. Objective We aimed to investigate whether antidepressant fluoxetine induces multiple antibiotic resistances and reveal underlying mechanisms. Methodology Escherichia coli K12 was exposed to different concentrations of fluoxetine (0, 0.5, 5, 50 and 100\,mg/L) and the resistant strains were isolated by plating on antibiotic containing plates. Resistant strains were randomly selected to determine the increase of minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) of multiple antibiotics. Genome-wide DNA sequencing was performed on cells cultured in lysogeny broth (LB) without any fluoxetine or antibiotics exposure. RNA sequencing and proteomic profiling of isolated mutants grown in LB with 100\,mg/L fluoxetine were analyzed to reveal the underlying mechanisms. Results Exposure of Escherichia coli to fluoxetine at 5\textendash 100\,mg/L after repeated subculture in LB for 30\,days promoted its mutation frequency resulting in increased resistance against the antibiotics chloramphenicol, amoxicillin and tetracycline. This increase was up to 5.0\,\texttimes\,107 fold in a dose-time pattern. Isolated mutants with resistance to one of these antibiotics also exhibited multiple resistances against fluoroquinolone, aminoglycoside, {$\beta$}-lactams, tetracycline and chloramphenicol. According to global transcriptional and proteomic analyses, the AcrAB-TolC pump together with the YadG/YadH transporter, a Tsx channel and the MdtEF-TolC pump have been triggered to export the antibiotics to the exterior of the cell. Whole-genome DNA analysis of the mutants further revealed that ROS-mediated mutagenesis (e.g., deletion, insertion, and substitution) of DNA-binding transcriptional regulators (e.g., marR, rob, sdiA, cytR and crp) to up-regulate the expression of efflux pumps, may further enhance the antibiotic efflux. Conclusions Our findings for the first time demonstrated that the exposure to antidepressant fluoxetine induces multiple antibiotic resistance in E. coli via the ROS-mediated mutagenesis.},

Across two studies (Study 1: N = 1,032, Study 2: N = 303) examining men and women from multiple racial groups (Asian, Black, and White adults), we found that although race does impact judgments of size and strength, raters' judgments primarily track targets' objective physical features. In some cases, racial stereotypes actually improved group-level accuracy, as these stereotypes aligned with racial-group differences in size and strength according to nationally representative data. We conclude that individuals primarily rely on individuating information when making physical judgments but do not completely discount racial stereotypes, which reflect a combination of real group-level differences and culturally transmitted beliefs.},

  abstract = {Several behavioral disorders, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), bipolar disorder, and aggressive behaviors are linked with sugar intake and obesity. The reason(s) for this association has been unclear. Here we present a hypothesis supporting a role for fructose, a component of sugar and high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), and uric acid (a fructose metabolite), in increasing the risk for these behavioral disorders. Recent studies have shown that the reason fructose intake is strongly associated with development of metabolic syndrome is that fructose intake activates an evolutionary-based survival pathway that stimulates foraging behavior and the storage of energy as fat. While modest intake may aid animals that would like to store fat as a protective response from food shortage or starvation, we propose that high intake of sugar and HFCS causes a hyperactive foraging response that stimulates craving, impulsivity, risk taking and aggression that increases the risk for ADHD, bipolar disease and aggressive behavior. High glycemic carbohydrates and salty foods may also contribute as they can be converted to fructose in the body. Some studies suggest uric acid produced during fructose metabolism may mediate some of these effects. Chronic stimulation of the pathway could lead to desensitization of hedonic responses and induce depression. In conclusion, a hyperactive foraging response driven by high glycemic carbohydrates and sugars may contribute to affective disorders.},

We examined whether chronic diseases and social risk factors (poverty, divorce, and perceived lack of emotional support) are differently associated with somatic and cognitive/affective symptoms of depression. Methods Cross-sectional analyses were based on individual-level data from the 31,191 participants of six cross-sectional U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) carried out between 2005 and 2016. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire. Information on chronic diseases and social risk factors was self-reported by participants. Results After adjustment for sex, age, race/ethnicity, and all the of other symptoms besides the outcome symptom, higher number of chronic diseases was independently related to fatigue, psychomotor retardation/agitation, and sleep problems in a dose-response pattern (range of odds ratios: 1.21 to 2.59). Except for concentration problems, social risk factors were associated with almost all of the cognitive/affective symptoms (range of odds ratios: 1.02 to 2.09) but only sporadically with somatic symptoms. Limitations All measures were self-reported by the participants, which may have introduced bias to the associations. Cross-sectional data did not allow us to study temporal dynamics.

These recommendations include: (1) playing to our strength in longitudinal, place-based research, (2) collaborating more broadly, (3) engaging in greater public communication of science, (4) aligning our work with open-science practices to the extent possible, and (5) increasing diversity of our field and teams through intentional action, outreach, training, and mentorship.

Data Sources Web of Science; Science Direct; SPORTDiscus; CINAHL; and MEDLINE were searched from inception to June 2020. Eligibility Criteria Studies where males and females older than 50 years of age performed identical resistance training interventions and had outcome measures of muscle strength or size. Results We initially screened 5337 studies. 30 studies (with 41 comparison groups) were included in our review (1410 participants; 651 males, 759 females). Mean study quality was 14.7/29 on a modified Downs and Black checklist, considered moderate quality. Females gained more relative lower-body strength than males (g\,=\,-\,0.21 [95\% CI -\,0.33, -\,0.10], p\,=\,0.0003) but there were no differences in relative change for upper-body strength (g\,=\,-\,0.29 [95\% CI -\,0.62, 0.04], p\,=\,0.08) or relative muscle size (g\,=\,0.10 [95\% CI -\,0.04, 0.23], p\,=\,0.16).

However, it is evident that the interpretation of sex-dependent adaptations to resistance training is heavily influenced by the presentation of the results in either an absolute or relative context.

The majority of the participants did not choose the more effective judgement strategy and they did not systematically alter their behaviour as a function of task experience. Instead, a subset of the participants selected judgement strategies on the basis of a learning goal, that is, a strategy that let them restudy both words in a pair.

Methods: This observational secondary analysis come from the largest perinatal data registry in the United States related to the midwifery-led birth center model care (American Association of Birth Centers Perinatal Data Registry; N = 19 286). Births are planned across all birth settings (home, birth center, hospital); care is provided by midwives and physicians.  Results: Population data show that both early and persistent self-reports of cannabis use were associated with higher rates of preterm birth, low-birth-weight, lower 1-minute Apgar score, gestational weight gain, and postpartum hemorrhage. Once controlled for medical and social risk factors using logistic regression, differences for childbearing people disappeared except that the persistent use group was less likely to experience ``no intrapartum complications'' (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.49; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.32-0.76; P {$<$} .01), more likely to experience an indeterminate fetal heart rate in labor (aOR = 3.218; 95\% CI, 2.23-4.65; P {$<$} .05), chorioamnionitis (aOR = 2.8; 95\% CI, 1.58-5.0; P {$<$} .01), low-birth-weight (aOR = 1.8; 95\% CI, 1.08-3.05; P {$<$} .01), and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission (aOR = 2.4; 95\% CI, 1.30-4.69; P {$<$} .05).  Conclusions: Well-controlled data demonstrate that self-reports of persistent cannabis use through the third trimester are associated with an increased risk of low-birth-weight and NICU admission.},

DESIGN A prospective, naturalistic investigation of patients with unipolar MDEs, studied systematically at intake and during up to 31 years of follow-up. SETTING Five US academic medical centers. PARTICIPANTS Patients entered the National Institute of Mental Health Collaborative Depression Study during an MDE in 1978, 1979, 1980, or 1981. Patients with unipolar MDE at intake (n = 536) were divided into those with and those without current comorbid overtly expressed irritability/anger. EXPOSURE In this observational, longitudinal study, patients received treatment that was recorded but not controlled. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Groups were compared on illness severity and chronicity, psychosocial impairment, quality of life, suicidal behavior, lifetime comorbid diagnoses, impulse control, and measures associated with bipolarity. RESULTS Overt irritability/anger was present in 292 of 536 participants with a unipolar MDE at study intake (54.5\%). It was associated with significantly increased depressive severity, longer duration of the index MDE, poorer impulse control, a more chronic and severe long-term course of illness, higher rates of lifetime comorbid substance abuse and anxiety disorder, more antisocial personality disorders, greater psychosocial impairment before intake and during follow-up, reduced life satisfaction, and a higher rate of bipolar II disorder in relatives. No association was found with increased suicidal ideation or behavior. Results were not explained by comorbidity or other manic spectrum symptoms. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study extends results of cross-sectional investigations and indicates that irritability/anger during MDEs is a highly prevalent clinical marker of a more severe, chronic, and complex depressive illness. Findings have important implications for assessment and treatment.},

Research suggests that, at peak fertility, women tend to prefer men with characteristics that reflect good genes for short-term sexual relationships. However, existing findings have been criticized for methodological flexibility and failing attempts to replicate core results. In a large (N=157), pre-registered, within-subject study spanning two ovulatory cycles, we investigated cycle shifts in women's mate preferences for masculine bodies. Using a large set of natural stimuli, we found that when fertile, women's ratings of male bodies increased for sexual as well as for long-term attractiveness. Both effects were partially mediated by the estradiol-to-progesterone-ratio. Furthermore, moderation analyses revealed that both shifts were only evident in women in relationships, but not in singles. Contrary to previous findings, male masculine traits did not interact with cycle phase to predict attraction, indicating that women's preferential priorities do not shift. Taken together, our results do not support women's mate preference shifts, as assumed by the good genes ovulatory shift hypothesis, but are consistent with shifting motivational priorities throughout the cycle. Implications of these results for female estrus theories and methodological recommendations for future research are discussed.},

In the current chapter, we examine the interactions between social status and prosocial behavior, and we show that causation goes in both directions. On the one hand, laboratory and field evidence show that prosocial behavior can be a means of achieving, or maintaining, elevated status and accessing the accompanying material and social rewards. On the other hand, possessing status can also affect prosocial behavior (for better or worse) by altering the costs and benefits of prosociality, for example, by affecting people's dependence on others, their vested interest in others, their ability to be prosocial, and their need for status maintenance. Status thus influences the use of prosocial behavior, but can increase it or decrease it depending on the context and the specific type of prosocial behavior. By understanding this bi-directional causation and applying it, we can harness people's desire for status to promote prosocial behaviors by ensuring its visibility and by fostering competitive altruism.},

In particular, we focus on commonly used neutrality tests and discuss the interpretation of their results. We argue that one needs to be careful with interpreting the consistency (or inconsistency) of archaeological data with theoretical neutral expectations as evidence for the absence (or presence) of selective force in the population. While neutral theory does very well in replicating various population-level frequency patterns, many alternative processes of cultural transmission may do so, too, making the pattern-matching approach a fairly weak approach for inferring underlying transmission processes. We advocate the use of generative inference frameworks as one possibility to go beyond the hypothesis testing approach. These frameworks do not only allow for the identification of the most likely underlying learning process given the empirical data but for a description of the breadth of processes that could have produced these data equally well. This brings us a step closer to understanding the limits to inferring underlying transmission processes from population-level frequency data and therefore the kinds of questions can be answered with which kinds of data.},

Associations between poverty and women's increased risk of intimate partner violence have been observed. We therefore aimed to assess the effect of a violence prevention intervention delivered to women participating in a group-based microfinance scheme in Tanzania.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Methods{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}We did a cluster randomised controlled trial among women taking part in a microfinance loan scheme in Mwanza city, Tanzania. A microfinance loan group was only enrolled if at least 70\% of members consented. We randomly assigned the microfinance groups in blocks of six to receive either the intervention (ie, the intervention arm) or be wait-listed for the intervention after the trial (ie, the control arm). Women in both arms of the trial met weekly for loan repayments. Only those in the intervention arm participated in the ten-session MAISHA intervention that aims to empower women and prevent intimate partner violence. Given the nature of the intervention, it was not possible to mask participants or the research team. The primary outcome was a composite of reported past-year physical or sexual intimate partner violence, or both. Secondary outcome measures were past-year physical, sexual, and emotional intimate partner violence; acceptability and tolerance of intimate partner violence; and attitudes and beliefs related to intimate partner violence. These outcomes were assessed 24 months after the intervention. An intention-to-treat analysis was done, adjusting for age, education, and baseline measure of the respective outcome. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02592252.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Findings{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Between September, 2014, and June, 2015, 66 (65\%) of 101 microfinance groups approached in the study area met the trial eligibility criteria and were enrolled, of which 33 (n=544 women) were allocated to the intervention arm and 33 (n=505 women) to the control arm. Overall, 485 (89\%) of 544 women in the intervention arm and 434 (86\%) of 505 in the control arm completed the outcomes assessment. Among the intervention arm, 112 (23\%) of 485 women reported past-year physical or sexual intimate partner violence, or both, compared with 119 (27\%) of 434 in the control arm (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0{$\cdot$}69, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}47\textendash 1{$\cdot$}01; p=0{$\cdot$}056).

Because of the resulting sex bias in the empirical evidence, this overview of the mechanisms and consequences of intrasexual selection focuses on male reproductive strategies. All traits that increase the probability of obtaining mating opportunities, even minimally, are positively evaluated by intrasexual selection. Sexually-selected adaptations are found in very different traits, but behaviour plays a prominent role in implementing many of them. The presentation of these adaptations follows the logical chronological sequence of events by distinguishing between pre- and post-copulatory competition. The basic concept of a strategy, which applies to both sexes, is presented before this discussion for a better appreciation of sex-specific adaptations within the context of reproduction.},

The adverse health risk behaviors and psychobiological changes associated with depression increase the risk for chronic medical disorders, and biological changes and complications associated with chronic medical disorders may precipitate depressive episodes. Comorbid depression is associated with increased medical symptom burden, functional impairment, medical costs, poor adherence to self-care regimens, and increased risk of morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic medical disorders. Depression may worsen the course of medical disorders because of its effect on proinflammatory factors, hypothalamic-pituitary axis, autonomic nervous system, and metabolic factors, in addition to being associated with a higher risk of obesity, sedentary lifestyle, smoking, and poor adherence to medical regimens. Both evidence-based psychotherapies and antidepressant medication are efficacious treatments for depression. Collaborative depression care has been shown to be an effective way to deliver these treatments to large primary care populations with depression and chronic medical illness.},

This form of risk pooling consists of connected individuals in a social network transferring wealth from those above a threshold, e.g.~welfare threshold, to individuals below threshold in order to preserve the recipient's viable participation in the economy. Such systems are of interest to researchers ranging from evolutionary biologists studying the food sharing of bats to anthropologists studying the gifting of cattle among pastoral societies or mutual help arrangements among ranchers. In this paper, the comprehensive impact of transfer organization and network evolution is studied using agent-based simulations. It is found that in the short-term an optimal transfer rule is similar to a regressive cutting-stock optimization heuristic; however, such a rule has detrimental long-term impact as it leads to a vulnerable wealth distribution. Thus an optimal transfer scheme should both efficiently execute immediate disaster recovery and establish a secure wealth distribution. Also, the most successful network evolution model is one that encourages low variance in the node degrees, leading to equal sharing of the risk and benefit of such an NBT insurance relationship. These results provide a motivated guidance for empirical studies of existing NBT practices and suggestions for optimal implementation of similar resource management in volatile environments.},

  abstract = {Background Although severe depression is dysfunctional, the capacity to experience normal low mood may be useful in certain fitness-threatening situations. Moreover, if specific kinds of situations recurred often enough in the course of evolution, natural selection may have shaped partially differentiated subtypes of low mood that are parallel to the subtypes of anxiety that protect against different kinds of danger. To test this hypothesis, we examined how symptoms of low mood differ depending upon the precipitating situation, and whether these differences match expectations of symptoms useful in each kind of situation. Method 337 subjects who experienced a period of low mood within the last year wrote accounts describing perceived causes of their low mood and they filled out the CES-D depression inventory. Seven symptom scales were derived from analysis of CES-D data. Independent judges blindly coded the accounts into one of six precipitant categories. Results Different untoward situations were associated with different symptoms that were predicted to be useful in those situations. Social losses (death of a loved one, romantic breakups, and social isolation) were associated with greater crying and arousal. Failure to reach a goal, stress, and winter seasons were associated with more fatigue and pessimism. Discussion These results suggest that natural selection shaped not only a generic state of low mood but also partially differentiated subtypes shaped to cope with specific situations that were associated with fitness losses among our ancestors.},

  abstract = {Given that natural selection is so powerful at optimizing complex adaptations, why does it seem unable to eliminate genes (susceptibility alleles) that predispose to common, harmful, heritable mental disorders, such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder? We assess three leading explanations for this apparent paradox from evolutionary genetic theory: (1) ancestral neutrality (susceptibility alleles were not harmful among ancestors), (2) balancing selection (susceptibility alleles sometimes increased fitness), and (3) polygenic mutation-selection balance (mental disorders reflect the inevitable mutational load on the thousands of genes underlying human behavior). The first two explanations are commonly assumed in psychiatric genetics and Darwinian psychiatry, while mutation-selection has often been discounted. All three models can explain persistent genetic variance in some traits under some conditions, but the first two have serious problems in explaining human mental disorders. Ancestral neutrality fails to explain low mental disorder frequencies and requires implausibly small selection coefficients against mental disorders given the data on the reproductive costs and impairment of mental disorders. Balancing selection (including spatio-temporal variation in selection, heterozygote advantage, antagonistic pleiotropy, and frequency-dependent selection) tends to favor environmentally contingent adaptations (which would show no heritability) or high-frequency alleles (which psychiatric genetics would have already found). Only polygenic mutation-selection balance seems consistent with the data on mental disorder prevalence rates, fitness costs, the likely rarity of susceptibility alleles, and the increased risks of mental disorders with brain trauma, inbreeding, and paternal age. This evolutionary genetic framework for mental disorders has wide-ranging implications for psychology, psychiatry, behavior genetics, molecular genetics, and evolutionary approaches to studying human behavior.},

Information about stressful life events and onset of major depressive episodes in the past year was collected in a population-based sample of female-female twin pairs including 2,164 individuals, 53,215 person-months of observation, and 492 onsets of depression. Nine "personal" and three aggregate "network" stressful events significantly predicted onset of major depression in the month of occurrence, four of which predicted onset with an odds ratio of {$>$} 10 and were termed "severe": death of a close relative, assault, serious marital problems, and divorce/breakup. Genetic liability also had a significant impact on risk of onset of depression. For severe stressful events, as well as for 10 of the 12 individual stressful events, the best-fitting model for the joint effect of stressful events and genetic liability on onset of major depression suggested genetic control of sensitivity to the depression-inducing effects of stressful life events. In individuals at lowest genetic risk (monozygotic twin, co-twin unaffected), the probability of onset of major depression per month was predicted to be 0.5\% and 6.2\%, respectively, for those unexposed and exposed to a severe event. In those at highest genetic risk (monozygotic twin, co-twin affected), these probabilities were 1.1\% and 14.6\%, respectively. Linear regression analysis indicated significant Genotype by Environment interaction in the prediction of onset of major depression. Genetic factors influence the risk of onset of major depression in part by altering the sensitivity of individuals to the depression-inducing effect of stressful life events.},

Although overwhelming evidence suggests that  genetic  and environmental risk factors both contribute to the aetiology of major  depression (MD), we know little of how these  two risk factor domains inter-relate. In particular, can the genetic liability  to MD increase the risk of experiencing stressful life events (SLEs)?Methods. Using discrete time survival analysis in a population-based  sample of 2164 female  twins, we examined whether the risks for nine personal and three aggregate  network  SLEs were  predicted by the level of genetic liability to MD, indexed by the lifetime  history  of MD in monozygotic and dizygotic co-twins.Results. Genetic liability to MD was associated with a significantly  increased risk for six personal SLEs (assault, serious marital problems,  divorce/breakup, job loss, serious illness and  major financial problems) and one network SLE (trouble getting along with  relatives/friends).  This effect was not due to SLEs occurring during depressive episodes. Similar  results were  found using structural equation twin modelling. In contrast to the pattern  observed  with MD, the genetic liability to alcoholism impacted on the risk for being  robbed and having trouble with the law.Conclusion. In women, genetic risk factors for MD increase  the  probability of experiencing  SLEs in the interpersonal and occupational/financial domains. Genes  can  probably impact on  the risk for psychiatric illness by causing individuals to select themselves  into high risk environments.},

The sample contained 24,648 person-months, 316 onsets of MD, and 239 onsets of GAD. SLEs were rated on long-term contextual threat and dependence. Discrete time-survival analyses were employed. The association between SLEs and depressive onsets was usually strongest in the month of occurrence but extended for "difficulty-like" events for up to 6 months. The depressogenic effect of SLEs was strongly predicted by contextual threat level, although some low threat events significantly increased risk for MD. The risk for a depressive onset given the number of reported SLEs within one month was: no event, 0.9\%; one, 3.4\%; two, 6.8\%; and three, 23.8\%. Although a few events were relatively specifically depressogenic or anxiogenic, most SLEs increased risk for both MD and GAD. The risk period produced by SLEs range from short-lived to relatively prolonged. High threat events encompass most but not all of the depressogenic effects of SLEs. Multiple SLEs in the same month substantially increase the risk for a depressive onset. The specificity of most SLEs for depressive versus anxiety syndromes is modest.},

However, exposure to stressful life events is influenced by genetic factors, and these factors are correlated with those that predispose to major depression. The aim of this study was to clarify the degree to which stressful life events cause major depression. METHOD: The authors assessed the occurrence of 15 classes of stressful life events and the onset of DSM-III-R major depression over a 1-year period in female twins ascertained from a population-based registry. The sample contained 24,648 person-months and 316 onsets of major depression. Stressful life events were individually rated on contextual threat and dependence (the degree to which the stressful life event could have resulted from the respondent's behavior). The nature of the relationship between stressful life events and major depression was tested by 1) discrete-time survival analysis examining the relationship between dependence and the depressogenic effect of stressful life events and 2) a co-twin control analysis. RESULTS: While independent stressful life events were significantly associated with onsets of depression, when level of threat was controlled, the association was significantly stronger for dependent events. The odds ratio for onset of major depression in the month of a stressful life event was 5.64 in all subjects, 4.52 within dizygotic pairs, and 3.58 within monozygotic pairs. CONCLUSIONS: Stressful life events have a substantial causal relationship with the onset of episodes of major depression. However, about one-third of the association between stressful life events and onsets of depression is noncausal, since individuals predisposed to major depression select themselves into high-risk environments.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Women are at greater risk for major depression than men. The authors sought to determine whether the gender difference in prevalence for major depression was due to more frequent exposure to stressful life events and/or greater sensitivity to their depressogenic effects. METHOD: Male-male, female-female, and male-female twin pairs from a popu-lation-based registry were personally interviewed. Each interview assessed the occurrence, to the nearest month, of 18 personal and social network classes of stressful life events and episode onsets of major depression. Standard logistic regression analyses were conducted for the same-sex pairs, and each female twin in the opposite-sex pairs was compared with her male co-twin by using conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Women consistently reported higher rates of housing problems, loss of confidant, crises and problems getting along with individuals in their proximal network, and illness of individuals within their distal network. In both the same-sex and opposite-sex samples, men reported higher rates of job loss, legal problems, robbery, and work problems. Consistent sex differences in the depressogenic effect of stressful life events were seen for three event categories: men were more sensitive to the depressogenic effects of divorce or separation and work problems; women were more sensitive to the depressogenic effects of problems getting along with individuals in their proximal network. None of the gender difference in prevalence of major depression could be explained by differing rates of or sensitivities to stressful life events. CONCLUSIONS: Women reported more interpersonal whereas men reported more legal and work-related stressful life events. Most life event categories influenced the risk for major depression similarly in the two sexes. The results suggest that the greater prevalence of major depression in women versus men is due neither to differences in the rates of reported stressful life events nor to differential sensitivity to their pathogenic effect.},

A depressive episode that is bereavement-related and has clinical features and course characteristic of normal grief is not diagnosed as major depression. This study evaluates the empirical validity of this exclusion criterion.           Method:           To determine the similarities of bereavement-related depression and depression related to other stressful life events, the authors identified and compared cases on a range of validators in a large-population-based sample of twins. The authors evaluated whether cases of bereavement-related depression that also met DSM criteria for ``normal grief'' were qualitatively distinct from other depressive cases.           Results:           Eighty-two individuals with confirmed bereavement-related depression and 224 with confirmed depression related to other stressful life events were identified. The two groups did not differ in age at onset of major depression, number of prior episodes, duration of index episode, number of endorsed ``A criteria,'' risk for future episodes, pattern of comorbidity, levels of extraversion, risk for major depression in their co-twin, or the proportion meeting criteria for ``normal grief.'' However, individuals with bereavement-related depression were slightly older, and more likely to be female, and had lower levels of neuroticism, treatment-seeking, and guilt and higher levels of fatigue and loss of interest. Interaction analyses failed to find unique features of people whose illness met criteria for both bereavement-related depression and normal grief compared to those whose illness was related to other life stressors.           Conclusions:           The similarities between bereavement-related depression and depression related to other stressful life events substantially outweigh their differences. These results question the validity of the bereavement exclusion for the diagnosis of major depression.},

During this time period, 44,112 individuals completed the questionnaire. This sample was 65.3\% female, 85.4\% 18 years or older, 72.0\% Caucasian and had a mean educational level of 12.2 years.

A range of checks suggested low levels of invalid data. Correlations for personality, substance use and misuse, lifetime major depression, social attitudes, educational status, and height and weight were broadly similar to those obtained previously using conventional assessment methods. Web-based studies are a relatively easy and inexpensive way to ascertain large numbers of individuals, although obtaining twin pairs is more difficult, and female and monozygotic pairs are overrepresented.

Method. Questionnaires were completed on a website, yielding a sample of 44 112 subjects including both members of 542 same-sex twin pairs. Personality was measured by the Big Five Inventory.

Three of the big-five personality traits \textendash{} O, E and A \textendash{} had small phenotypic associations with risk for MD and small genetic correlations. Two traits \textendash{} N and C \textendash{} had stronger phenotypic associations (positive for N and negative for C) with the following estimates of the genetic correlation with MD : +0.43 for N and x0.36 for C. N and C were moderately negatively correlated. Controlling for N reduced the genetic correlation between C and MD more than controlling for C reduced the genetic correlation between N and MD.

Method Stressful life events (SLEs) and MD onsets in the last year were assessed at four waves in cohort 1 (females) and at two waves in cohort 2 (males and females) from the Virginia Adult Twin Study. Structural equation modeling was conducted in Mplus. Results In cohort 1, DV was strongly indexed by depressive episodes over the four waves (paths from +0.72 to 0.79) and predicted by SLEs in the month of their occurrence (+0.31 to 0.36). Wave-specific DV was associated both with stable DV (+0.29 to 0.33) and by forward transmission of DV from the preceding wave (+0.33 to 0.36). SLEs were predicted by stable DV (+0.29) and from SLEs in the preceding month (+0.06). As the cohort aged, MD onsets were better indexed by DV and more poorly predicted by SLEs. Parameter estimates were similar in males and females from cohort 2. In individuals with prior depressive episodes, the association between MD onset and SLEs was weakened while the prediction of SLEs from DV was substantially strengthened. We found no evidence for `reverse causation' from MD episodes to SLEs. Conclusion The interrelationship between DV and acute adversity in the etiology of MD is complex and temporally dynamic. DV impacts on MD risk both directly and indirectly through selection into high stress environments. Over time, depressive episodes become more autonomous. Both DV and SLEs transmit forward over time and therefore form clear targets for intervention.},

  abstract = {The modern concept of depression arose from earlier diagnostic formulations of melancholia over the hundred years from the 1780s to the 1880s. In this historical sketch, this evolution is traced from the writings of 12 authors outlining the central roles played by the concepts of faculty psychology and understandability. Five of the authors, writing from 1780 through the 1830s, including Cullen, Pinel, and Esquirol, defined melancholia as a disorder of intellect or judgment, a "partial insanity" often, but not always, associated with sadness. Two texts from the 1850s by Guislain, and Bucknill and Tuke were at the transition between paradigms. Both emphasized a neglected disorder-melancholia without delusions-arguing that it reflected a primary disorder of mood-not of intellect. In the final phase in the 1860s to 1880s, 5 authors (Griesinger, Sankey, Maudsley, Krafft-Ebing, and Kraepelin) all confronted the problem of the cause of delusional melancholia. Each author concluded that melancholia was a primary mood disorder and argued that the delusions emerged understandably from the abnormal mood. In this 100-year period, the explanation of delusional melancholia in faculty psychology terms reversed itself from an intellect to mood to a mood to intellect model. The great nosologists of the 19th century are often seen as creating our psychiatric disorders using a simple inductive process, clustering the symptoms, signs, and later the course of the patients. This history suggests 2 complexities to this narrative. First, in addition to bottom-up clinical studies, these nosologists were working top-down from theories of faculty psychology proposed by 18th century philosophers. Second, for patient groups experiencing disorders of multiple faculties, the nosologists used judgments about understandability to assign primary causal roles. This historical model suggests that the pathway from patient observation to the nosologic categories-the conceptual birth of our diagnostic categories-has been more complex than is often realized.},

Coercion by recipients normally involves limiting an actor's options. Here, we consider the possibility of a coercive recipient limiting its own options. Forty years ago, Amotz Zahavi suggested that nesting birds may be ``blackmailed'' into increased parental care if offspring threaten to harm themselves (and therefore jeopardize the direct fitness of their parents). In a simple kin selection model, we expand blackmail to indirect fitness and highlight that blackmail can occur between any kin to drive reproductive division of labor. In principle, a recipient may place its own fitness at risk (brinkmanship), imposing sanctions on a relative's indirect fitness if the relative fails to cooperate. To use its own survival or reproduction as leverage in a sequential game, a recipient must increase the extent to which its existing fitness depends on the actor's behavior and therefore credibly commit to a cost if the actor does not comply. As it requires opportunities for commitment, kin blackmail can arise only under stringent conditions, but existing kin blackmailers may pass unnoticed because of their strategic success.},

Here, we investigate if there is prospective evidence for biomarkers derived from leading theories.

Searches were performed in Pubmed, Embase and PsychInfo for articles published up to 06/2019. References and citations of included articles were screened to identify additional articles. Inclusion criteria were having an MDD diagnosis as outcome, a biomarker as predictor, and prospective design search terms were formulated accordingly. PRISMA guidelines were applied. Meta-analyses were performed using a random effect model when three or more comparable studies were identified, using a random effect model. Our search resulted in 67,464 articles, of which 75 prospective articles were identified on: Neuroimaging (N\,=\,24), Gastrointestinal factors (N\,=\,1), Immunology (N\,=\,8), Neurotrophic (N\,=\,2), Neurotransmitters (N\,=\,1), Hormones (N\,=\,39), Oxidative stress (N\,=\,1). Meta-analyses on brain volumes and immunology markers were not significant. Only cortisol (N\,=\,19, OR\,=\,1.294, p\,=\,0.024) showed a predictive effect on onset/relapse/recurrence of MDD, but not on time until MDD onset/relapse/recurrence. However, this effect disappeared when studies including participants with a baseline clinical diagnosis were removed from the analyses. Other studies were too heterogeneous to compare. Thus, there is a lack of evidence for leading biological theories for onset and maintenance of depression. Only cortisol was identified as potential predictor for MDD, but results are influenced by the disease state. High-quality (prospective) studies on MDD are needed to disentangle the etiology and maintenance of MDD.},

  abstract = {Among the most consistent sex differences to emerge from personality research is that women score higher than men on the Big Five personality trait Neuroticism. However, there are few functionally coherent explanations for this sex difference. The current studies tested whether this sex difference is due, in part, to variation in physical capital. Two preregistered studies (total N = 878 U.S. students) found that sex differences in the anxiety facet of Neuroticism were mediated by variation in physical strength and self-perceived formidability. Study 1 (N = 374) did not find a predicted mediation effect for overall Neuroticism but found a mediation effect for anxiety (the facet of Neuroticism most strongly associated with grip strength). Study 2 (N = 504) predicted and replicated this mediation effect. Further, sex differences in anxiety were serially mediated by grip strength and self-perceived formidability. These findings add to a nascent literature suggesting that differences in physical attributes may partially explain sex differences in personality.},

  abstract = {, Political and social attitudes have been shown to differ by sex in a way that tracks individual self-interest. We propose that these attitudes also change strategically to serve the best interests of either male or female kin. To test this hypothesis, we developed a measure of gendered fitness interests (GFI) \textendash{} an index which reflects the sex, relatedness and residual reproductive value of close kin. We predicted that people with male-biased GFI (i.e. people with more male kin of a reproductive age) would have more conservative attitudes towards gender-related issues (e.g. gender roles, women's rights, abortion rights). An online study using an American sample (N = 560) found support for this hypothesis. Further analyses revealed that this relationship was driven not only by people's own sex and reproductive value but also by those of their descendant kin. Exploratory analyses also found a positive association between male-biased GFI and a measure of conformity, as well as a smaller association between male-biased GFI and having voted Republican in the last election. Both of these associations were statistically mediated by gender-related conservatism. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that GFI influences sociopolitical attitudes.},

Clinical reinterviews used the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV.ResultsThe prevalence of CIDI MDD for lifetime was 16.2\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 15.1-17.3) (32.6-35.1 million US adults) and for 12-month was 6.6\% (95\% CI, 5.9-7.3) (13.1-14.2 million US adults). Virtually all CIDI 12-month cases were independently classified as clinically significant using the QIDS-SR, with 10.4\% mild, 38.6\% moderate, 38.0\% severe, and 12.9\% very severe. Mean episode duration was 16 weeks (95\% CI, 15.1-17.3). Role impairment as measured by SDS was substantial as indicated by 59.3\% of 12-month cases with severe or very severe role impairment. Most lifetime (72.1\%) and 12-month (78.5\%) cases had comorbid CIDI/DSM-IV disorders, with MDD only rarely primary. Although 51.6\% (95\% CI, 46.1-57.2) of 12-month cases received health care treatment for MDD, treatment was adequate in only 41.9\% (95\% CI, 35.9-47.9) of these cases, resulting in 21.7\% (95\% CI, 18.1-25.2) of 12-month MDD being adequately treated. Sociodemographic correlates of treatment were far less numerous than those of prevalence.ConclusionsMajor depressive disorder is a common disorder, widely distributed in the population, and usually associated with substantial symptom severity and role impairment. While the recent increase in treatment is encouraging, inadequate treatment is a serious concern. Emphasis on screening and expansion of treatment needs to be accompanied by a parallel emphasis on treatment quality improvement.},

A synthesis of evidence from the fossil record, paleogenomics, human ecology, and disease transmission models, suggests that care-giving for the diseased evolved as part of the unique suite of cognitive and socio-cultural specializations that are attributed to the genus Homo. Here we demonstrate that the evolution of hominin social structure enabled the evolution of care-giving for the diseased. Using agent-based modeling, we simulate the evolution of care-giving in hominin networks derived from a basal primate social system and the three leading hypotheses of ancestral human social organization, each of which would have had to deal with the elevated disease spread associated with care-giving. We show that (1) care-giving is an evolutionarily stable strategy in kin-based cooperatively breeding groups, (2) care-giving can become established in small, low density groups, similar to communities that existed before the increases in community size and density that are associated with the advent of agriculture in the Neolithic, and (3) once established, care-giving became a successful method of disease control across social systems, even as community sizes and densities increased. We conclude that care-giving enabled hominins to suppress disease spread as social complexity, and thus socially-transmitted disease risk, increased.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Muscular function, such as handgrip strength, has been suggested as an associated factor for cognitive impairment. This study investigated the association between temporal change in handgrip strength and cognitive function using longitudinal, nationwide data from Korean older adults. METHODS: Our study used data from the Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging (KLoSA). The analysis covered 6696 participants who had taken the handgrip strength test and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) from 2006 to 2018. We adopted general estimating equations to assess the temporal effect of handgrip strength change on cognitive function. RESULTS: After adjusting for covariates, we observed an association between handgrip strength and low MMSE scores ({$\beta$}\,=\,-\,0.3142 in men, {$\beta$}\,=\,-\,0.2685 in women). Handgrip strength as a continuous variable was positively correlated with MMSE scores after adjustment ({$\beta$}\,=\,0.0293 in men, {$\beta$}\,=\,0.0347 in women). The group with decreased handgrip strength over time also showed greater odds for mild cognitive impairment (OR\,=\,1.23, 95\%CI\,=\,1.05-1.27 in men, OR\,=\,1.15, 95\%CI\,=\,1.05-1.27 in women) and dementia (OR\,=\,1.393, 95\%CI\,=\,1.18-1.65 in men, OR\,=\,1.19, 95\%CI\,=\,1.08-1.32 in women). CONCLUSIONS: This study identified the relationship between handgrip strength change and cognitive function among South Korean adults. According to our large, longitudinal sample, decreasing handgrip strength was associated with decline in cognitive function.},

In 3 sets of experiments, we tested this hypothesis by factorially manipulating metamemory monitoring accuracy and self-regulation of study. To manipulate monitoring accuracy, we compared judgments of learning (JOLs) made contemporaneously with a delayed retrieval attempt to JOLs either made at a delay without attempting retrieval or made immediately after study; in previous studies, delayed retrieval-based JOLs have robustly predicted recall with greater relative accuracy than have the other JOL types. To manipulate self-regulation of study, in Experiments 1A\textendash 1C and 2A\textendash 2C, we compared conditions in which participants' restudy selections were honored with conditions in which they were completely or randomly dishonored; in Experiments 3A\textendash 3C, we randomly honored or dishonored half of the restudy selections and half of the nonselections. Results revealed that the benefit of delayed, retrieval-based JOLs for final memory performance was due largely to the selection of more items for restudy rather than to better discriminations between items that would benefit more versus less from restudy. In most cases, gains in recall due to greater self-regulation of study did not increase with better monitoring accuracy; when they did, the effect was extremely small. The surprising conclusion was that restudy decisions were not very much more efficacious under conditions that yield greater monitoring accuracy than under those that do not.},

We propose a new hypothesis to help explain many of depression's symptoms and its risk factors, most of them not explained by previous evolutionary theories. We hypothesize that the evolutionary costs of depression are offset by its benefits in combating existing infections and avoiding new ones. As our hypothesis predicts, depression can be elicited by various infections as well as by environmental stressors that compromise immune function. Moreover, many depressive symptoms tend to aid immune function and reduce exposure to new infections and stressors. The hypothesis makes many predictions about the epidemiology and physiology of depression that are supported by available evidence. The hypothesis also suggests that possible underlying infectious and immune factors deserve greater consideration in prevention and treatment of depression.},

  abstract = {Group members do not always act cohesively when facing extra-group rivals. When benefits such as group-defence are not monopolizable, it poses an economics problem: who should contribute to public goods and who should freeload? A collective action framework compliments existing theoretical explanations for cooperation, and provides testable hypotheses about group-level behaviour based on individual costs and benefits. Using this approach, we review research on intergroup encounters in non-human primates published over the last 20 years, focusing on participation by different classes of individuals. While food- and mate-defence explain much between-sex variation in participation, rank and reproductive access frequently explain within-sex variation. In some species, individuals may use intergroup interactions to survey potential transfer locations and mating options, which might coincidently intimidate rivals. Experimental evidence suggests that when intergroup dominance is based on relative number of fighters, individual participation still varies with sex, rank, companion behaviour and dependent offspring presence. Relatively few studies have examined how factors such as relationships within and between groups or individual temperament mediate aggression. Long-term studies of multiple habituated groups and methodological advances (e.g., playback experiments) will continue to improve our understanding of how complex group-level patterns are predictable when viewed from an individual perspective.},

  abstract = {From the Preface, by Arthur Kleinman:Patients and Healers in the Context of Culture presents a theoretical framework for studying the relationship between medicine, psychiatry, and culture. That framework is principally illustrated by materials gathered in field research in Taiwan and, to a lesser extent, from materials gathered in similar research in Boston. The reader will find this book contains a dialectical tension between two reciprocally related orientations: it is both a cross-cultural (largely anthropological) perspective on the essential components of clinical care and a clinical perspective on anthropological studies of medicine and psychiatry. That dialectic is embodied in my own academic training and professional life, so that this book is a personal statement.~I am a psychiatrist trained in anthropology. I have worked in library, field, and clinic on problems concerning medicine and psychiatry in Chinese culture. I teach cross-cultural psychiatry and medical anthropology, but I also practice and teach consultation psychiatry and take a clinical approach to my major cross-cultural teaching and research involvements. The theoretical framework elaborated in this book has been applied to all of those areas; in turn, they are used to illustrate the theory. Both the theory and its application embody the same dialectic. The purpose of this book is to advance both poles of that dialectic: to demonstrate the critical role of social science (especially anthropology and cross-cultural studies) in clinical medicine and psychiatry and to encourage study of clinical problems by anthropologists and other investigators involved in cross-cultural research.},

It is, however, less clear whether wealthier individuals live longer because they can afford certain goods and services not available to people with lower incomes, or because of indirect factors. This project investigates the role of intergenerational exchange in the relationship between income and mortality. In the previous literature on the link between income and longevity, this factor has seldom been analysed. We develop an agent-based model to examine the exchange relationship in a two-generational family. In the model, older parents use increases in their pension income as intergenerational transfers to younger family members, and receive emotional or functional support in return. Taking advantage of the natural experiment of the German reunification, we estimate our model using realistic demographic, economic, and time use data. Our results imply that intra-familial resource exchange is beneficial for both the health of older parents and the living conditions of adult children in times of economic uncertainty. The findings therefore suggest that increases in pension income may affect old-age survival, both directly through the amenities elderly people can buy with the additional income, and indirectly through intergenerational transfers that incentivise adult children to provide support to their parents.},

But recent work in the field of social endocrinology points to a fundamental role for hormones in human status hierarchies. In this chapter, we review evidence of the reciprocal relationship between hormones and hierarchical status, focusing on human endocrine systems that influence and respond to social behavior in pursuit of status. We introduce basic anatomy and physiology pertinent to understanding each hormone's role in human status, relying on animal research as needed to inform our discussion. We selectively review research on testosterone and its relationship to dominant behavior as well as the relationship between cortisol, stress, and status. We then turn to recent evidence on the interaction between testosterone and cortisol in status hierarchies. Estradiol and oxytocin are examined next in relation to female and intergroup status hierarchies, respectively. We conclude with future directions for research on the interplay between hormones and hierarchies.},

Objective: Examine the contribution of metamemory judgment accuracy and use of learning strategies to self-regulated learning in adults with ADHD, focusing on the use of self-testing. Method: A total of 34 adults with ADHD and 34 matched controls predicted their memory performance and regulated their learning of paired associates. Results: Adults with ADHD were as accurate as controls at predicting memory performance, despite remembering fewer words. By observation and self-report, they were less likely to use self-testing to learn the pairs. Conclusion: Across groups, self-testing was associated with significantly better recall and largely accounted for differences between diagnostic groups. Adults with ADHD often failed to employ a strategy that was associated with improved memory, identifying an intervention target that may improve self-regulated learning.},

In Study 2, we collected BDEFS and GPA goals from students at a women's college (N = 229) and obtained grades from the registrar. EF deficits predicted GPA concurrently and prospectively even when controlling for prior grades. Self-motivation problems were most consistently related to grades and mediation analysis revealed a significant indirect effect via lower grade goals. However, goals did not fully account for this relationship. While our results suggest potential value for goal-setting interventions, additional measures to improve self-regulation are likely needed to help struggling students with self-motivation problems.},

Study design We used state-specific data from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (N\,=\,9013) to describe correlates of self-reported prenatal and postpartum marijuana use. We estimated differences in mean infant birth weight and gestational age among prenatal marijuana users and nonusers, controlling for relevant covariates (i.e., cigarette smoking). Results Respectively, 4.2\% (95\% CI: 3.8\textendash 4.7) and 6.8\% (95\% CI: 6.0\textendash 7.7) of women reported using marijuana during and after pregnancy. Compared to nonusers, prenatal marijuana users were more likely to be {$\leq$}24\,years; non-Hispanic white, not married, have {$<$}12\,years of education, have Medicaid/IHS/Other insurance, be on WIC during pregnancy, have annual household income {$<\$$}20,000, cigarette smokers, and alcohol drinkers during pregnancy (p-values\,{$<$}\,0.05). After adjustment, no differences in gestational age or birthweight were observed. Postpartum users were more likely to smoke cigarettes (48.7\% vs. 20.3\%), experience postpartum depressive symptoms (14.0\% vs. 9.0\%), and breastfeed for {$<$}8 weeks (34.9\% vs. 18.1\%). Conclusion Co-use of substances was common among prenatal and postpartum marijuana users. Prenatal marijuana use was not independently associated with lower average birthweight or gestational age. Postpartum marijuana use was associated with depressive symptoms and shorter breastfeeding duration. Surveillance of marijuana use among pregnant and postpartum women is critical to better understanding the relationship of marijuana use with birth outcomes, and postpartum experiences such as depression and breastfeeding.},

Pooled standard mean difference (SMD) and odds ratios (ORs) were calculated.Depression scores after treatment and adverse effects.Ten publications reporting on 14 trials (6262 participants) were included: 10 trials evaluated the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (n\,=\,4258) and 4 investigated cytokine inhibitors (n\,=\,2004). The pooled effect estimate suggested that anti-inflammatory treatment reduced depressive symptoms (SMD, -0.34; 95\% CI, -0.57 to -0.11; I2\,=\,90\%) compared with placebo. This effect was observed in studies including patients with depression (SMD, -0.54; 95\% CI, -1.08 to -0.01; I2\,=\,68\%) and depressive symptoms (SMD, -0.27; 95\% CI, -0.53 to -0.01; I2\,=\,68\%). The heterogeneity of the studies was not explained by differences in inclusion of clinical depression vs depressive symptoms or use of NSAIDs vs cytokine inhibitors. Subanalyses emphasized the antidepressant properties of the selective cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor celecoxib (SMD, -0.29; 95\% CI, -0.49 to -0.08; I2\,=\,73\%) on remission (OR, 7.89; 95\% CI, 2.94 to 21.17; I2\,=\,0\%) and response (OR, 6.59; 95\% CI, 2.24 to 19.42; I2\,=\,0\%). Among the 6 studies reporting on adverse effects, we found no evidence of an increased number of gastrointestinal or cardiovascular events after 6 weeks or infections after 12 weeks of anti-inflammatory treatment compared with placebo. All trials were associated with a high risk of bias owing to potentially compromised internal validity.Our analysis suggests that anti-inflammatory treatment, in particular celecoxib, decreases depressive symptoms without increased risks of adverse effects. However, a high risk of bias and high heterogeneity made the mean estimate uncertain. This study supports a proof-of-concept concerning the use of anti-inflammatory treatment in depression. Identification of subgroups that could benefit from such treatment might be warranted.},

Using cross-sectional data from the Berlin Aging Study II (BASE-II; Mage = 68 years, SD = 3.68; 50\% women; N = 1,514), we examine age differences in behavioral (sexual activity), cognitive (sexual thoughts), and emotional (intimacy) facets of sexuality and investigate associations with physical health and psychosocial resources for successful aging. Older age was associated with less sexual activity and fewer sexual thoughts, but not with differences in intimacy. Relative to a reference sample of 22- to 36-year-olds within BASE-II (N = 475), the average older adult reported considerably fewer sexual activity and thoughts (ds {$>$} .60), but only slightly lower intimacy (d = .20). Substantial heterogeneity existed among older adults, with almost one third of the 60- to 82-year-olds reporting more sexual activity and thoughts than the average younger adult. Examining correlates of sexuality among older adults revealed that, covarying for diagnosed illnesses and performance-based grip strength, psychosocial factors (e.g., partnered, relationship satisfaction) accounted for considerable shares of variance in sexual activity and intimacy, whereas age and gender explained more of the variance in sexual thoughts. Some psychosocial factors exhibited similar-sized associations with all sexuality facets, whereas other factors operated in more facet-specific ways. To illustrate, participants reporting more loneliness also reported less sexual activity and less intimacy, but not fewer sexual thoughts. We discuss implications of our findings for theories of successful aging. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)},

In a sample of men (N = 164), we sought to provide further evidence on the effects of men's physical dominance and sexual attractiveness on mating success and hence in sexual selection. Objective measures and subjective ratings of male sexually dimorphic traits purportedly under sexual selection (height, vocal and facial masculinity, upper body size from 3D scans, physical strength, and baseline testosterone) and observer perceptions of physical dominance and sexual attractiveness based on self-presentation video recordings were assessed and associated with mating success (sociosexual behaviour and number of potential conceptions) in a partly longitudinal design. Results from structural equation models and selection analyses revealed that physical dominance, but not sexual attractiveness, predicted mating success. Physical dominance mediated associations of upper body size, physical strength, as well as vocal and facial physical dominance and attractiveness with mating success. These findings thus suggest a greater importance of intrasexual competition than female choice in human male sexual selection.},

In these circumstances, inter-generational reproductive conflicts between younger and older females are predicted to resolve in favor of the younger females, who realize fewer inclusive fitness benefits from ceding reproduction to others. This conceptual model anticipates that immigrants to a community initially have few kin ties to others in the group, gradually showing greater relatedness to group members as they have descendants who remain with them in the group. We examine this prediction in a cross-cultural sample of communities, which vary in their sex-biased dispersal patterns and other aspects of social organization. Drawing on genealogical and demographic data, the analysis provides general but not comprehensive support for the prediction that average relatedness of immigrants to other group members increases as they age. In rare cases, natal members of the community also exhibit age-related increases in relatedness. We also find large variation in the proportion of female group members who are immigrants, beyond simple traditional considerations of patrilocality or matrilocality, which raises questions about the circumstances under which this hypothesis of female competition are met. We consider possible explanations for these heterogenous results, and we address methodological considerations that merit increased attention for research on kinship and reproductive conflict in human societies.},

  abstract = {Emotion regulation researchers often assume that global self-report questionnaires capture momentary emotion regulation processes that occur in everyday life; however, this assumption remains largely untested. To test this assumption, we analyzed data from 10 daily life studies (Total N = 1,198) in which participants reported their use of cognitive reappraisal, expressive suppression, and rumination using both global questionnaires and diary/experience sampling methods. We investigated three forms of global-momentary correspondence. First, we examined how global self-reports of emotion regulation correlated with the stable between-person component of momentary self-reports, labelled mean-level correspondence. Meta-analyses across studies revealed only weak (reappraisal) to moderate (suppression, rumination) mean-level correspondence. Second, we examined how global self-reports correlated with the degree to which momentary emotion regulation is contingent on preceding affect, which we label identification correspondence. Meta-analyses revealed that higher global rumination was associated with momentary use of all three strategies that wasless contingent on preceding negative affect intensity. Finally, we investigated how global self-reports correlated with the effect of momentary regulation on subsequent affect, labelled implementation correspondence. Meta-analyses revealed that higher global reappraisal was associated with larger decreases in negative affect following momentary reappraisal. Taken together, our findings suggest that global self-reports do not always map clearly onto the stable trait component of momentary emotion regulation, but may instead reflect individual differences in the affective antecedents and consequences of emotion regulation.},

  abstract = {Despite the near universal assumption of individuality in biology, there is little agreement about what individuals are and few rigorous quantitative methods for their identification. Here, we propose that individuals are aggregates that preserve a measure of temporal integrity, i.e., ``propagate'' information from their past into their futures. We formalize this idea using information theory and graphical models. This mathematical formulation yields three principled and distinct forms of individuality\textemdash an organismal, a colonial, and a driven form\textemdash each of which varies in the degree of environmental dependence and inherited information. This approach can be thought of as a Gestalt approach to evolution where selection makes figure-ground (agent\textendash environment) distinctions using suitable information-theoretic lenses. A benefit of the approach is that it expands the scope of allowable individuals to include adaptive aggregations in systems that are multi-scale, highly distributed, and do not necessarily have physical boundaries such as cell walls or clonal somatic tissue. Such individuals might be visible to selection but hard to detect by observers without suitable measurement principles. The information theory of individuality allows for the identification of individuals at all levels of organization from molecular to cultural and provides a basis for testing assumptions about the natural scales of a system and argues for the importance of uncertainty reduction through coarse-graining in adaptive systems.},

  abstract = {The demographic success of humans compared with other closely related species can be attributed to the relatively rapid pace of reproduction and improved chances of survival. The assistance that mothers receive from others to help raise children is a common theme in explaining this gain in surviving fertility. Cooperative breeding in its broad definition describes such a social system in which nonmaternal helpers support offspring who are not their own. In traditional societies, kin and nonkin of different ages and sex contribute both to child care and to provisioning older children. This review discusses empirical evidence for human cooperative breeding and its demographic significance and highlights the ways in which humans are similar to and different from other cooperative breeders. An emphasis is placed on cross-cultural comparison and variability in allocare strategies. Because helping in humans occurs within a subsistence pattern of food sharing and labor cooperation, both kin selection and mutualism may explain why children are often raised with nonmaternal help. Cooperative breeding is relevant to debates in anthropology concerning the evolution of human life history, sociality, and psychology and has implications for demographic patterns in today's world as well as in the past.},

  abstract = {Background An accurate diagnosis of helminth infection is important to improve patient management. However, there is considerable intra- and inter-specimen variation of helminth egg counts in human feces. Homogenization of stool samples has been suggested to improve diagnostic accuracy, but there are no detailed investigations. Rapid disintegration of hookworm eggs constitutes another problem in epidemiological surveys. We studied the spatial distribution of Schistosoma mansoni and hookworm eggs in stool samples, the effect of homogenization, and determined egg counts over time in stool samples stored under different conditions. Methodology Whole-stool samples were collected from 222 individuals in a rural part of south C\^ote d'Ivoire. Samples were cut into four pieces and helminth egg locations from the front to the back and from the center to the surface were analyzed. Some samples were homogenized and fecal egg counts (FECs) compared before and after homogenization. The effect of stool storing methods on FECs was investigated over time, comparing stool storage on ice, covering stool samples with a water-soaked tissue, or keeping stool samples in the shade. Principal Findings We found no clear spatial pattern of S. mansoni and hookworm eggs in fecal samples. Homogenization decreased S. mansoni FECs (p = 0.026), while no effect was observed for hookworm and other soil-transmitted helminths. Hookworm FECs decreased over time. Storing stool samples on ice or covered with a moist tissue slowed down hookworm egg decay (p{$<$}0.005). Conclusions/Significance Our findings have important implications for helminth diagnosis at the individual patient level and for epidemiological surveys, anthelmintic drug efficacy studies and monitoring of control programs. Specifically, homogenization of fecal samples is recommended for an accurate detection of S. mansoni eggs, while keeping collected stool samples cool and moist delayed the disintegration of hookworm eggs.},

  abstract = {Close friendships are associated with greater happiness and improved health; historically, they would likely have provided beneficial fitness outcomes. Yet each friendship requires one's finite time and resources to develop and maintain. Because people can maintain only so many close relationships, including friendships, at any one time, choosing which prospective friends to pursue and invest in is likely to have been a recurrent adaptive problem. Moreover, not all friends are created equal; some might be kind but unintelligent, some intelligent but disloyal, and so on. How might people integrate their friend preferences to make friend choices? Work using a Euclidean model of mate preferences has had significant success in elucidating this integration challenge in the domain of mating. Here, we apply this model to the domain of friendship, specifically exploring same-sex best and close friendships. We test and find some support for several critical predictions derived from a Euclidean integration hypothesis: People with higher Euclidean friend value (a) have best friends who better fulfill their best friend preferences, (b) have higher friend-value ideal best friends, and (c) have higher friend-value actual best friends. We also (d) replicate existing similar findings with regard to mating and (e) additionally provide a first test of whether people's Euclidean friend value (versus mate value) is a better predictor of their friend outcomes, and vice versa, finding some, albeit mixed, support for the dissocialbility of these constructs.},

However, it is still seldom considered that senescence may not only affect an individual but also affect age-specific reproductive success in its offspring, generating transgenerational reproductive senescence. We used long-term data from wild yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventer) living in two different elevational environments to quantify age-specific reproductive success of daughters born to mothers differing in age. Contrary to prediction, daughters born to older mothers had greater annual reproductive success on average than daughters born to younger mothers, and this translated into greater lifetime reproductive success. However, in the favorable lower elevation environment, daughters born to older mothers also had greater age-specific decreases in annual reproductive success. In the harsher higher elevation environment on the other hand, daughters born to older mothers tended to die before reaching ages at which such senescent decreases could be observed. Our study highlights the importance of incorporating environment-specific transgenerational parent age effects on adult offspring age-specific life-history traits to fully understand the substantial variation observed in senescence patterns in wild populations.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: While considerable attention has focused on improving the detection of depression, assessment of severity is also important in guiding treatment decisions. Therefore, we examined the validity of a brief, new measure of depression severity. MEASUREMENTS: The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is a self-administered version of the PRIME-MD diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. The PHQ-9 is the depression module, which scores each of the 9 DSM-IV criteria as ``0'' (not at all) to ``3'' (nearly every day). The PHQ-9 was completed by 6,000 patients in 8 primary care clinics and 7 obstetrics-gynecology clinics. Construct validity was assessed using the 20-item Short-Form General Health Survey, self-reported sick days and clinic visits, and symptom-related difficulty. Criterion validity was assessed against an independent structured mental health professional (MHP) interview in a sample of 580 patients. RESULTS: As PHQ-9 depression severity increased, there was a substantial decrease in functional status on all 6 SF-20 subscales. Also, symptom-related difficulty, sick days, and health care utilization increased. Using the MHP reinterview as the criterion standard, a PHQ-9 score {$\geq$}10 had a sensitivity of 88\% and a specificity of 88\% for major depression. PHQ-9 scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represented mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively. Results were similar in the primary care and obstetrics-gynecology samples. CONCLUSION: In addition to making criteria-based diagnoses of depressive disorders, the PHQ-9 is also a reliable and valid measure of depression severity. These characteristics plus its brevity make the PHQ-9 a useful clinical and research tool.},

  abstract = {Tolerance, the ability of a host to limit the negative fitness effects of a given parasite load, is now recognised as an important host defence strategy in animals. Together with resistance, the ability of a host to limit parasite load, these two host strategies represent two disparate host responses to parasites, each with different predicted evolutionary consequences: resistance is predicted to reduce parasite prevalence, whereas tolerance could be neutral towards, or increase, parasite prevalence in a population. The distinction between these two strategies might have far-reaching epidemiological consequences. Classically, a reaction norm defines host tolerance because it depicts the change in host fitness as a function of parasite load, where a shallow negative slope indicates that host fitness slowly deteriorates as parasite load increases (i.e., high tolerance). Despite the fact that tolerance was only recently acknowledged to be an important component in an animal's immune repertoire, it is frequently referenced, so our aim is to emphasise the current advances on the topic. We begin by summarising the ways in which biologists measure the two components of tolerance, parasite load and fitness, as well as the ways in which the concept has been defined (i.e., point and range tolerance). It is common to test for variation in host tolerance according to intrinsic, innate factors, where variation exists among populations, genders or genotypes. Such variation in tolerance is pervasive across animal taxa, and we briefly review some of the mechanistic bases of variation that have recently begun to be explored. Three further novel advancements in the tolerance field are the appreciation of the role of extrinsic, environmental factors on tolerance, host tolerance in multi-host\textendash parasite systems and individual-based approaches to tolerance measures. We explore these topics using recent examples and suggest some future perspectives. It is becoming increasingly clear that an appreciation of tolerance as a defence strategy can provide significant insights into how hosts coexist with parasites.},

  abstract = {Background Microbial communities in human milk and those in feces from breastfed infants vary within and across populations. However, few researchers have conducted cross-cultural comparisons between populations, and little is known about whether certain ``core'' taxa occur normally within or between populations and whether variation in milk microbiome is related to variation in infant fecal microbiome. The purpose of this study was to describe microbiomes of milk produced by relatively healthy women living at diverse international sites and compare these to the fecal microbiomes of their relatively healthy infants. Methods We analyzed milk (n = 394) and infant feces (n = 377) collected from mother/infant dyads living in 11 international sites (2 each in Ethiopia, The Gambia, and the US; 1 each in Ghana, Kenya, Peru, Spain, and Sweden). The V1-V3 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was sequenced to characterize and compare microbial communities within and among cohorts. Results Core genera in feces were Streptococcus, Escherichia/Shigella, and Veillonella, and in milk were Streptococcus and Staphylococcus, although substantial variability existed within and across cohorts. For instance, relative abundance of Lactobacillus was highest in feces from rural Ethiopia and The Gambia, and lowest in feces from Peru, Spain, Sweden, and the US; Rhizobium was relatively more abundant in milk produced by women in rural Ethiopia than all other cohorts. Bacterial diversity also varied among cohorts. For example, Shannon diversity was higher in feces from Kenya than Ghana and US-California, and higher in rural Ethiopian than Ghana, Peru, Spain, Sweden, and US-California. There were limited associations between individual genera in milk and feces, but community-level analyses suggest strong, positive associations between the complex communities in these sample types. Conclusions Our data provide additional evidence of within- and among-population differences in milk and infant fecal bacterial community membership and diversity and support for a relationship between the bacterial communities in milk and those of the recipient infant's feces.

  abstract = {Expressions of sexual interest on the part of professors toward students can be unfairly coercive due to the power dynamic involved. Three experiments (totaling 336 participants) explore a different cost of such sexual overtures or ``passes.'' That cost involves students' interest in pursuing success in the scholarly field in which the pass occurred. U.S. college students, both male and female, contemplated receiving a pass from a professor who had previously praised their abilities in a valued field of study. Afterwards, compared to their peers who did not contemplate such a pass, those who did imagine a pass reported decreased academic identification (Experiments 1 and 3), more negative perceptions about how their professor viewed them (and more negative perceptions of their professor; Experiments 1\textendash 3), and lower state self-esteem (Experiment 3). Female students were more susceptible to these deleterious consequence than were male students, and the difference persisted regardless of the professor's gender (Experiment 2). This gender difference was due in part to women's more intense reaction to the doubts that the pass raised for them about their academic fitness. These results hold important implications for how sexual advances in academic settings should be viewed by suggesting an important and previously undocumented set of negative consequences that arise when professors make passes at students.},

Indeed, some of the best experimental evidence for animal traditions can be found in fishes.

Further studies reveal surprisingly complex social learning strategies deployed by sticklebacks. We will go on to place these observations of fish in a phylogenetic context, describing in which respects the learning and traditionality of fish are similar to, and differ from, that observed in other animals. We end by drawing on theoretical insights to suggest processes that may have played important roles in the evolution of the human cultural capability.},

  abstract = {Objectives Bioarchaeological research has documented a general decline in health with the transition from foraging to farming, primarily with respect to changing patterns of morbidity. Less is known about changes in injury risk, an aspect of health more obviously tied to particular landscapes and behaviors associated with different subsistence regimes. The purpose of this research is to evaluate several hypotheses emerging from the ideal free distribution model (Fretwell \& Lucas, ) that predict injury risk based on subsistence-specific practices and land use patterns. Materials and Methods Postcranial fracture frequencies for long bones and clavicles in human skeletal remains from three Southeast U.S. regions permit examination of variability in injury risk among low-intensity (floodplain) farmers. Published data on six hunter-gatherer samples, four low-intensity agriculturalist samples, and six high-intensity agriculturalist samples comprise a comparative sample for examining variability in injury risk across three distinct subsistence traditions. Differences are evaluated using Z scores and the Fisher Exact test, Chi-Square test, and Mann\textendash Whitney U test. Results While statistically significant differences are apparent among low-intensity farming groups in the Southeast sample, in the global comparison postcranial fractures are significantly less common in low-intensity agriculturalists than in hunter-gatherers or high-intensity agriculturalists. Discussion The results of this study support the hypothesis that, with respect to traumatic injury risk, low-intensity farming is a risk-averse subsistence strategy in comparison with full-time foraging or high-intensity agriculture. These data suggest that it is not agriculture per se that predicts an increase in this health risk, but rather the mode and intensity of agricultural production, findings that have important ramifications for our understanding of the health consequences of major subsistence transitions.},

  abstract = {Objectives Establishment and development of the infant gastrointestinal microbiome (GIM) varies cross-culturally and is thought to be influenced by factors such as gestational age, birth mode, diet, and antibiotic exposure. However, there is little data as to how the composition of infants' households may play a role, particularly from a cross-cultural perspective. Here, we examined relationships between infant fecal microbiome (IFM) diversity/composition and infants' household size, number of siblings, and number of other household members. Materials and methods We analyzed 377 fecal samples from healthy, breastfeeding infants across 11 sites in eight different countries (Ethiopia, The Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Peru, Spain, Sweden, and the United States). Fecal microbial community structure was determined by amplifying, sequencing, and classifying (to the genus level) the V1\textendash V3 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. Surveys administered to infants' mothers identified household members and composition. Results Our results indicated that household composition (represented by the number of cohabitating siblings and other household members) did not have a measurable impact on the bacterial diversity, evenness, or richness of the IFM. However, we observed that variation in household composition categories did correspond to differential relative abundances of specific taxa, namely: Lactobacillus, Clostridium, Enterobacter, and Klebsiella. Discussion This study, to our knowledge, is the largest cross-cultural study to date examining the association between household composition and the IFM. Our results indicate that the social environment of infants (represented here by the proxy of household composition) may influence the bacterial composition of the infant GIM, although the mechanism is unknown. A higher number and diversity of cohabitants and potential caregivers may facilitate social transmission of beneficial bacteria to the infant gastrointestinal tract, by way of shared environment or through direct physical and social contact between the maternal\textendash infant dyad and other household members. These findings contribute to the discussion concerning ways by which infants are influenced by their social environments and add further dimensionality to the ongoing exploration of social transmission of gut microbiota and the ``old friends'' hypothesis.},

  abstract = {How can collective action evolve when individuals benefit from cooperation regardless of whether they pay its participation costs? According to one influential perspective, collective action problems are common, especially when groups are large, but may be solved when individuals who have more to gain from the collective good or can produce it at low costs provide it to others as a byproduct. Several results from a 20-y study of one of the most striking examples of collective action in nonhuman animals, territorial boundary patrolling by male chimpanzees, are consistent with these ideas. Individuals were more likely to patrol when (i) they had more to gain because they had many offspring in the group; (ii) they incurred relatively low costs because of their high dominance rank and superior physical condition; and (iii) the group size was relatively small. However, several other findings were better explained by group augmentation theory, which proposes that individuals should bear the short-term costs of collective action even when they have little to gain immediately if such action leads to increases in group size and long-term increases in reproductive success. In support of this theory, (i) individual patrolling effort was higher and less variable than participation in intergroup aggression in other primate species; (ii) males often patrolled when they had no offspring or maternal relatives in the group; and (iii) the aggregate patrolling effort of the group did not decrease with group size. We propose that group augmentation theory deserves more consideration in research on collective action.},

  abstract = {Establishment and maintenance of pregnancy represents a challenge for the maternal immune system since it has to defend against pathogens and tolerate paternal alloantigens expressed in fetal tissues. Regulatory T (Treg) cells, a subset of suppressor CD4+ T cells, play a dominant role in the maintenance of immunological self-tolerance by preventing immune and autoimmune responses against self-antigens. Although localized mechanisms contribute to fetal evasion from immune attack, in the last few years it has been observed that Treg cells are essential in promoting fetal survival avoiding the recognition of paternal semi-allogeneic tissues by maternal immune system. Several functional studies have shown that unexplained infertility, miscarriage and pre-clampsia are often associated with deficit in Treg cell number and function while normal pregnancy selectively stimulates the accumulation of maternal forkhead-boxP3+ (FoxP3+) CD4+ Treg cells with fetal specificity. Some papers have been reported that the number of Treg cells persists at elevated levels long after delivery developing an immune regulatory memory against father's antigens, moreover these memory Treg cells rapidly proliferate during subsequent pregnancies, however, on the other hand, there are several evidence suggesting a clear decline of Treg cells number after delivery. Different factors such as cytokines, adipokines, pregnancy hormones and seminal fluid have immunoregulatory activity and influence the success of pregnancy by increasing Treg cell number and activity. The development of strategies capable of modulating immune responses toward fetal antigens through Treg cell manipulation, could have an impact on the induction of tolerance against fetal antigens during immune-mediated recurrent abortion.},

A large literature has underestimated the effect of differences in body composition and the role of male contest competition for mates. It is often assumed that sexually dimorphic traits reflect a history of sexual selection, but natural selection frequently builds different phenotypes in males and females. The relatively small sex difference in stature ({$\sim$}7\%) and its decrease during human evolution have been widely presumed to indicate decreased male contest competition for mates. However, females likely increased in stature relative to males in order to successfully deliver large-brained neonates through a bipedally-adapted pelvis. Despite the relatively small differences in stature and body mass ({$\sim$}16\%), there are marked sex differences in body composition. Across multiple samples from groups with different nutrition, males typically have 36\% more lean body mass, 65\% more muscle mass, and 72\% more arm muscle than women, yielding parallel sex differences in strength. These sex differences in muscle and strength are comparable to those seen in primates where sexual selection, arising from aggressive male mating competition, has produced high levels of dimorphism. Body fat percentage shows a reverse pattern, with females having {$\sim$}1.6 times more than males and depositing that fat in different body regions than males. We argue that these sex differences in adipose arise mainly from natural selection on women to accumulate neurodevelopmental resources.},

Fitness landscapes used in this context are often based on imagery developed by Sewall Wright and depict a rugged topography of high-fitness peaks and low-fitness valleys. These landscape metaphors and models are used to explain both microscale changes in individual cultural forms and macroscale cultural transitions and diversifications. Recent research on the structure and dynamics of fitness landscapes, however, suggests that in many cases these rugged fitness landscapes may be misleading as they give rise to explanations that highlight the role of selection in directing cultural change and necessitate engagement with the problem of ``peak shifting'' in macroevolution. Advanced landscape theory suggests that realistic fitness landscapes may be highly multidimensional in nature, giving rise to a topography that includes neutral plateaus, ridges, and networks between peaks. This indicates that major cultural transitions as well as much microevolution may occur solely through neutral or nearly neutral changes, driven by drift rather than selection. We suggest that these advances in fitness landscape research may provide scholars of cultural change with powerful new imagery for theorizing patterns and processes in cultural evolution.},

Approximately 9756 individuals were included in the analysis after removing individuals with confounding conditions. Results The CRP levels, total white blood cell count, and white blood cell subpopulation counts increased with increasing body mass index (BMI). After controlling for BMI, female subjects had greater levels of most inflammatory markers compared with male subjects. After controlling for age, sex, and ethnicity, the following inflammatory markers significantly increased with increasing BMI: CRP and white blood cell, lymphocyte, monocyte, and neutrophil counts. Basophil and eosinophil counts also increased with increasing BMI but not significantly. Conclusions Factors, such as age, sex, and ethnicity, may modify the influence of obesity on subclinical inflammation at the population level.},

Accordingly, we have prioritized issues of diversity as editors, aiming to stimulate new connections and perspectives. Second, we call for greater recognition that human sex/gender roles and accompanying conflict behaviours are both subject to natural selection and culturally determined. This motivates our shift in terminology from sexual to gendered conflict when addressing human behaviour; countering stubborn tendencies to essentialize differences between women and men, and directing attention to the role of cultural practices, normative sanctions and social learning in structuring conflict battlegrounds. Finally, we draw attention to contemporary policy concerns, including the wellbeing consequences of marriage practices and the gendered implications of market integration. Focus on these themes, combined with attendance to the dangers of ethnocentrism, promises to inform culturally-sensitive interventions promoting gender equality worldwide.},

  abstract = {Global efforts to eradicate `child marriage' ({$<$}18 years) increasingly target governments, the private sector and the general public as agents of change. However, understanding of child marriage may be subject to popular misconceptions, particularly because of ambiguity in the age threshold implied by the term `child', and because awareness campaigns routinely emphasize extreme scenarios of very young girls forcibly married to much older men. Here, we ascertain public knowledge of child marriage via an online survey. Half of those surveyed mistakenly believed that the cut-off for child marriage is younger than the threshold of 18 years, and nearly three-quarters incorrectly believed that most child marriages occur at 15 years or below (it primarily occurs in later adolescence). Most participants also incorrectly believed that child marriage is illegal throughout the USA (it's illegal in only 4/50 states), substantially overestimated its global prevalence, and mistakenly believed that it primarily takes place among Muslim-majority world regions. Our results highlight important popular misconceptions of child marriage that may ultimately undermine global health goals and perpetuate harmful stereotypes. Organizations seeking to empower women by reducing child marriage should be cautious of these misunderstandings, and wary of the potential for their own activities to seed misinformation.},

  abstract = {, Achieving gender equality fundamentally requires a transfer of power from men to women. Yet data on men's support for women's empowerment (WE) remains scant and limited by reliance on self-report methodologies. Here, we examine men's support for WE as a sexual conflict trait, both via direct surveys (n = 590) and indirectly by asking men's wives (n = 317) to speculate on their husband's views. Data come from a semi-urban community in Mwanza, Tanzania. Consistent with reduced resource competition and increased exposure to relatively egalitarian gender norms, higher socioeconomic status predicted greater support for WE. However, potential demographic indicators of sexual conflict (high fertility, polygyny, large spousal age gap) were largely unrelated to men's support for WE. Contrasting self- and wife-reported measures suggests that men frequently exaggerate their support for women in self-reported attitudes. Discrepancies were especially pronounced among men claiming the highest support for WE, but smallest among men who held a professional occupation and whose wife participated in wage labour, indicating that these factors predict genuine support for WE. We discuss the implications of these results for our understanding of both individual variation and patriarchal gender norms, emphasising the benefits of greater exchange between the evolutionary human sciences and global health research on these themes.},

  abstract = {Three levels of social organization are recognized among human huntergatherers: the community, the domestic unit, and the band. We describe the key features of these three levels and show how they are intimately connected. We hypothesize that, in the course of human social evolution, bands emerged as a level of social organization within existing communities. As predators, hunter-gatherers live at lower population densities than chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), even where the two species are sympatric. We propose that band formation evolved in humans from the more transient fissioning behavior seen within chimpanzee communities as a solution to the conflicting pressures of sustaining higher levels of cooperation required in hunting and the division of labor in a more dispersed community. If disputes break out, or if resources in the band territory are temporarily depleted, the existence of a wider community continues to be adaptive. To reconstruct the evolution of band society, we draw upon four lines of evidence: group (or network) size predicted from neocortex ratios, the distance materials were moved from their source during various periods in hominin evolution, ethnographic data on hunter-gatherer daily foraging ranges and population densities collated by the authors, and fossil hominin morphology. From these data, we conclude that key features of modern human hunter-gatherer social organization probably appear in the course of the evolution of Homo heidelbergensis.},

  abstract = {Mood disorders (depression, bipolar disorders) are prevalent and disabling. They are also highly co-morbid with other psychiatric disorders. Currently there are no objective measures, such as blood tests, used in clinical practice, and available treatments do not work in everybody. The development of blood tests, as well as matching of patients with existing and new treatments, in a precise, personalized and preventive fashion, would make a significant difference at an individual and societal level. Early pilot studies by us to discover blood biomarkers for mood state were promising [1], and validated by others [2]. Recent work by us has identified blood gene expression biomarkers that track suicidality, a tragic behavioral outcome of mood disorders, using powerful longitudinal within-subject designs, validated them in suicide completers, and tested them in independent cohorts for ability to assess state (suicidal ideation), and ability to predict trait (future hospitalizations for suicidality) [3\textendash 6]. These studies showed good reproducibility with subsequent independent genetic studies [7]. More recently, we have conducted such studies also for pain [8], for stress disorders [9], and for memory/Alzheimer's Disease [10]. We endeavored to use a similar comprehensive approach to identify more definitive biomarkers for mood disorders, that are transdiagnostic, by studying mood in psychiatric disorders patients. First, we used a longitudinal within-subject design and whole-genome gene expression approach to discover biomarkers which track mood state in subjects who had diametric changes in mood state from low to high, from visit to visit, as measured by a simple visual analog scale that we had previously developed (SMS-7). Second, we prioritized these biomarkers using a convergent functional genomics (CFG) approach encompassing in a comprehensive fashion prior published evidence in the field. Third, we validated the biomarkers in an independent cohort of subjects with clinically severe depression (as measured by Hamilton Depression Scale, (HAMD)) and with clinically severe mania (as measured by the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS)). Adding the scores from the first three steps into an overall convergent functional evidence (CFE) score, we ended up with 26 top candidate blood gene expression biomarkers that had a CFE score as good as or better than SLC6A4, an empirical finding which we used as a de facto positive control and cutoff. Notably, there was among them an enrichment in genes involved in circadian mechanisms. We further analyzed the biological pathways and networks for the top candidate biomarkers, showing that circadian, neurotrophic, and cell differentiation functions are involved, along with serotonergic and glutamatergic signaling, supporting a view of mood as reflecting energy, activity and growth. Fourth, we tested in independent cohorts of psychiatric patients the ability of each of these 26 top candidate biomarkers to assess state (mood (SMS-7), depression (HAMD), mania (YMRS)), and to predict clinical course (future hospitalizations for depression, future hospitalizations for mania). We conducted our analyses across all patients, as well as personalized by gender and diagnosis, showing increased accuracy with the personalized approach, particularly in women. Again,~using SLC6A4 as the cutoff, twelve top biomarkers had the strongest overall evidence for tracking and predicting depression after all four steps: NRG1, DOCK10, GLS, PRPS1, TMEM161B, GLO1, FANCF, HNRNPDL, CD47, OLFM1, SMAD7, and SLC6A4. Of them, six had the strongest overall evidence for tracking and predicting both depression and mania, hence bipolar mood disorders. There were also two biomarkers (RLP3 and SLC6A4) with the strongest overall evidence for mania. These panels of biomarkers have practical implications for distinguishing between depression and bipolar disorder. Next, we evaluated the evidence for our top biomarkers being targets of existing psychiatric drugs, which permits matching patients to medications in a targeted fashion, and the measuring of response to treatment. We also used the biomarker signatures to bioinformatically identify new/repurposed candidate drugs. Top drugs of interest as potential new antidepressants were pindolol, ciprofibrate, pioglitazone and adiphenine, as well as the natural compounds asiaticoside and chlorogenic acid. The last 3 had also been identified by our previous suicidality studies. Finally, we provide an example of how a report to doctors would look for a patient with depression, based on the panel of top biomarkers (12 for depression and bipolar, one for mania), with an objective depression score, risk for future depression, and risk for bipolar switching, as well as personalized lists of targeted prioritized existing psychiatric medications and new potential medications. Overall, our studies provide objective assessments, targeted therapeutics, and monitoring of response to treatment, that enable precision medicine for mood disorders.},

Data-driven co-expression network module inference has the potential to account for variation within regulatory networks, reduce the dimensionality of RNA-Seq data, and detect significant gene-expression modules associated with depression severity. We performed an RNA-Seq gene co-expression network analysis of mRNA data obtained from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of unmedicated MDD (n\,=\,78) and healthy control (n\,=\,79) subjects. Across the combined MDD and HC groups, we assigned genes into modules using hierarchical clustering with a dynamic tree cut method and projected the expression data onto a lower-dimensional module space by computing the single-sample gene set enrichment score of each module. We tested the single-sample scores of each module for association with levels of depression severity measured by the Montgomery-\AA sberg Depression Scale (MADRS). Independent of MDD status, we identified 23 gene modules from the co-expression network. Two modules were significantly associated with the MADRS score after multiple comparison adjustment (adjusted p\,=\,0.009, 0.028 at 0.05 FDR threshold), and one of these modules replicated in a previous RNA-Seq study of MDD (p\,=\,0.03). The two MADRS-associated modules contain genes previously implicated in mood disorders and show enrichment of apoptosis and B cell receptor signaling. The genes in these modules show a correlation between network centrality and univariate association with depression, suggesting that intramodular hub genes are more likely to be related to MDD compared to other genes in a module.},

Our analysis conceptualizes status as the degree to which other people perceive that an individual possesses resources or personal characteristics that are important for the attainment of collective goals. That is, people have status to the degree that others perceive that they have instrumental social value. In being based on instrumental social value, status is distinguishable from interpersonal acceptance, which is based on relational value. Thus, the routes to obtaining status and respect are different from those that lead to acceptance and liking. The chapter discusses the central role that self-presentation plays in the pursuit of status, the ways in which people enhance their status through impression management, the features of social situations that moderate how people manage their public images in the pursuit of status, and the dilemma that people sometimes face in balancing their efforts to be respected and gain status with their efforts to be liked and accepted.},

Numerous studies using computational methods derived from evolutionary biology have been successfully applied to varied subset of linguistic data. One of the major drawback regarding musical studies is the lack of suitable coded musical data that can be analysed using such evolutionary tools. Here we present for the first time an original set of musical data coded in a way that enables construction of trees classically used in evolutionary approaches. Using phylogenetic methods, we test two competing theories on musical evolution: vertical versus horizontal transmission. We show that, contrary to what is currently believed, vertical transmission plays a key role in shaping musical diversity. The signal of vertical transmission is particularly strong for intrinsic musical characters such as metrics, rhythm, and melody. Our findings reveal some of the evolutionary mechanisms at play for explaining musical diversity and open a new field of investigation in musical evolution.},

In a followup homework assignment, students then explore how changes in phenotype frequency reflect changes in allele frequency in the population. This activity is suitable for anyone learning the basics of evolution, from high-school through the undergraduate level. We have provided detailed instructions, in-class worksheets, follow-up homework, and extensions that allow the activity to be simplified or made more complex as needed.

Children learn culture in several complementary ways, including through exploration, observation, participation, imitation, and instruction. These methods of learning vary in frequency and kind within and between populations due to variation in socialization values and practices associated with specific educational institutions, skill sets, and knowledge systems.

We show that the two negative emotions anger and disappointment have opposing effects in negotiations: anger pays when it is directed at the offer, but disappointment pays when it is directed at the person. Offer-directed anger elicits higher offers than person-directed anger, because people infer higher limits from opponents who communicate offer-directed anger. Person-directed disappointment elicits higher offers in others than offer-directed disappointment, because it evokes higher feelings of guilt. Our findings thus show that the interpersonal effects of anger and disappointment in negotiation depend critically on the target of the emotion, and that their effects can be explained by different processes.},

Yet, it is also argued that communicating disappointment serves as a call for help, which may elicit generous offers. Our goal was to resolve this apparent inconsistency. We develop the argument that communicating disappointment elicits generous offers when it evokes guilt in the target, but elicits low offers when it does not. In 4 experiments using both verbal (Experiments 1\textendash 3) and nonverbal (Experiment 4) emotion manipulations, we demonstrate that the interpersonal effects of disappointment depend on (a) the opponent's group membership and (b) the type of negotiation. When the expresser was an outgroup member and in representative negotiations (i.e., when disappointment did not evoke guilt), the weakness that disappointment communicated elicited lower offers. When the expresser was an ingroup member and in individual negotiations (i.e., when disappointment did evoke guilt), the weakness that disappointment communicated elicited generous offers from participants. Thus, in contrast to the common belief that weakness is a liability in negotiations, expressing disappointment can be effective under particular circumstances. We discuss implications for theorizing about the social functions of emotions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Background: Few studies have examined how maternal body mass index (BMI), mode of delivery and ethnicity affect the microbial composition of human milk and none have examined associations with maternal metabolic status. Given the high prevalence of maternal adiposity and impaired glucose metabolism, and the importance of human milk in the colonization of the infant gut, we systematically investigated the associations between these maternal factors and milk microbial composition and functionality. Methods: Women {$\geq$}20 years were recruited during pregnancy and milk samples were collected at 3 months post-partum (NCT01405547). Demographic data, weight, height, and a 3-hour oral glucose tolerance test were conducted at 30 (95\% CI: 25-33) weeks gestation. Metagenomic DNA extraction and 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing of the V4 hypervariable region (Illumina MiSeq) was carried out on 113 milk samples. Results: Multivariable linear regression analyses demonstrated no significant associations between maternal characteristics (maternal BMI [pre-pregnancy, 3 months post-partum], glucose tolerance, mode of delivery and ethnicity) and microbiota alpha-diversity; however, pre-pregnancy BMI was associated with human milk beta-diversity (Bray-Curtis p=0.040). Women with a pre-pregnancy BMI {$>$}30 kg/m2 (obese) had a greater incidence of Bacteroidetes (incidence rate ratio [IRR]: 3.70 [95\% CI: 1.61-8.48]) and a reduced incidence of Proteobacteria (0.62 [0.43-0.90]), compared to overweight women (BMI 25.0-29.9 kg/m2) as assessed by multivariable Poisson regression. Increased incidence of Gemella was observed among overweight (versus healthy) mothers with gestational diabetes (5.96 [1.85-19.21]) and obese (versus healthy) mothers with impaired glucose tolerance (4.04 [1.6310.01]). An increased incidence of Brevundimonas (16.70 [5.99-46.57]) was found in the milk of women who underwent an unscheduled C-section versus vaginal delivery. Lastly, functional gene inference demonstrated that obesity was associated with increased abundance of genes encoding for the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites in milk (coefficient=0.00028, p=0.0070). Conclusions: Mother's milk has a diverse microbiota of which its diversity and differential abundance appear associated with maternal body size, glucose tolerance status, mode of delivery, and ethnicity.},

  abstract = {Rationale There has been increasing attention on cannabis use for medical purposes, but there is currently a lack of data on its epidemiology. Objectives To examine the epidemiology of self-reported cannabis use for medical purposes by (1) estimating its prevalence, (2) comparing gender and age differences, and (3) investigating what reasons they were used to manage. Methods Participants included 27,169 respondents (aged 16\textendash 65) who completed Wave 1 of The International Cannabis Policy Study (ICPS) conducted across Canada and the USA in 2018 via online surveys. Cannabis policy conditions were ``US legal\textendash recreational'' (legal for both recreational and medical uses), ``US legal\textendash medical only'', ``US illegal'', and ``Canada\textendash medical only''. Results The overall prevalence of self-reported ever cannabis use for medical purposes was 27\%, with similar rates by sex and the highest prevalence in young adults. Prevalence was higher in US legal\textendash recreational states (34\%) than US illegal states (23\%), US legal\textendash medical only states (25\%), and Canada (25\%). The most common physical health reasons include use to manage pain (53\%), sleep (46\%), headaches/migraines (35\%), appetite (22\%), and nausea/vomiting (21\%). For mental health reasons, the most common were for anxiety (52\%), depression (40\%), and PTSD/trauma (17\%). There were 11\% who reported using cannabis for managing other drug or alcohol use and 4\% for psychosis. Conclusions A substantial proportion of the North American population self-reported cannabis use for medical purposes for a variety of medical reasons, including those living in jurisdictions without legal markets. Further research is needed to understand the safety and efficacy of these forms of medical cannabis use.

This study examined the relative influence of adversities during childhood and adulthood in accounting for individual differences in pro-inflammatory gene expression in late life. Using a pilot-sample from the Health and Retirement Study (N=114) aged from 51-95, OLS regression models were run to determine the association between a composite score from three proinflammatory gene expression levels (PTGS2, ILIB, and IL8) and 1) childhood trauma, 2) childhood SES, 3) childhood health, 4) adult traumas, and 5) low SES in adulthood. Our results showed that only childhood trauma was found to be associated with increased inflammatory transcription in late life. Furthermore, examination of interaction effects showed that childhood trauma exacerbated the influence of low SES in adulthood on elevated levels of inflammatory gene expression\textemdash signifying that having low SES in adulthood was most damaging for persons who had experienced traumatic events during their childhood. Overall our study suggests that traumas experienced during childhood may alter the stress response, leading to more sensitive reactivity throughout the lifespan. As a result, individuals who experienced greater adversity in early life may be at higher risk of late life health outcomes, particularly if adulthood adversity related to SES persists.},

Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores~{$\geq$}10 are nonetheless often used to estimate depression prevalence. We compared PHQ-9 {$\geq$}10 prevalence to Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (SCID) major depression prevalence and assessed whether an alternative PHQ-9 cutoff could more accurately estimate prevalence. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Individual participant data meta-analysis of datasets comparing PHQ-9 scores to SCID major depression status. RESULTS: A total of 9,242 participants (1,389 SCID major depression cases) from 44 primary studies were included. Pooled PHQ-9 {$\geq$}10 prevalence was 24.6\% (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 20.8\%, 28.9\%); pooled SCID major depression prevalence was 12.1\% (95\% CI: 9.6\%, 15.2\%); and pooled difference was 11.9\% (95\% CI: 9.3\%, 14.6\%). The mean study-level PHQ-9 {$\geq$}10 to SCID-based prevalence ratio was 2.5 times. PHQ-9 {$\geq$}14 and the PHQ-9 diagnostic algorithm provided prevalence closest to SCID major depression prevalence, but study-level prevalence differed from SCID-based prevalence by an average absolute difference of 4.8\% for PHQ-9 {$\geq$}14 (95\% prediction interval: -13.6\%, 14.5\%) and 5.6\% for the PHQ-9 diagnostic algorithm (95\% prediction interval: -16.4\%, 15.0\%). CONCLUSION: PHQ-9~{$\geq$}10 substantially overestimates depression prevalence. There is too much heterogeneity to correct statistically in individual studies.},

This is surprising, since forager children spend much of their time playing and foraging in child-only groups, and thus, have access to many potential child teachers. Using the Social Relations Model, we examined the prevalence of child-to-child teaching using focal follow data from 35 Hadza and 38 BaYaka 3- to 18-year-olds. We investigated the effect of age, sex and kinship on the teaching of subsistence skills. We found that child-to-child teaching was more frequent than adult-child teaching. Additionally, children taught more with age, teaching was more likely to occur within same-sex versus opposite-sex dyads, and close kin were more likely to teach than non-kin. The Hadza and BaYaka also showed distinct learning patterns; teaching was more likely to occur between sibling dyads among the Hadza than among the BaYaka, and a multistage learning model where younger children learn from peers, and older children from adults, was evident for the BaYaka, but not for the Hadza. We attribute these differences to subsistence and settlement patterns. These findings highlight the role of children in the intergenerational transmission of subsistence skills.},

To obtain epidemiologically relevant hand-grip strength data for pre-employment screening, we determined maximal isometric hand-grip strength in 1,654 healthy men and 533 healthy women aged 20-25 years. Moreover, to assess the potential margins for improvement in hand-grip strength of women by training, we studied 60 highly trained elite female athletes from sports known to require high hand-grip forces (judo, handball). Maximal isometric hand-grip force was recorded over 15 s using a handheld hand-grip ergometer. Biometric parameters included lean body mass (LBM) and hand dimensions. Mean maximal hand-grip strength showed the expected clear difference between men (541 N) and women (329 N). Less expected was the gender related distribution of hand-grip strength: 90\% of females produced less force than 95\% of males. Though female athletes were significantly stronger (444 N) than their untrained female counterparts, this value corresponded to only the 25th percentile of the male subjects. Hand-grip strength was linearly correlated with LBM. Furthermore, both relative hand-grip strength parameters (F (max)/body weight and F (max)/LBM) did not show any correlation to hand dimensions. The present findings show that the differences in hand-grip strength of men and women are larger than previously reported. An appreciable difference still remains when using lean body mass as reference. The results of female national elite athletes even indicate that the strength level attainable by extremely high training will rarely surpass the 50th percentile of untrained or not specifically trained men.},

We begin by identifying potential cross-correlates of depression using past clinical and cultural psychology literature. We then take a data-driven approach to modeling which factors correlate with depression in zero-order analyses, and in a multiple regression model that controls for covariation between factors. Our findings reveal several potential correlates of depression, including cultural individualism, daylight hours, divorce rate, and GDP per capita. Cultural individualism is the only factor that remains significant across all our models, even when adjusting for spatial autocorrelation, mental healthcare workers per capita, multicollinearity, and outliers. These findings shed light on how depression varies around the world, the sociocultural and environmental factors that underlie this variation, and potential future directions for the study of culture and mental illness.},

Hypotheses which attempt to explain the evolution of dimorphism in humans assume that more masculine men have historically achieved greater biological fitness. This may be because: more masculine men out-compete other men for mates; women preferentially select masculine men (e.g. due to their greater competitiveness and/or heritable immunocompetence); masculine men expend more energy on mating effort; and/or masculine men father more viable offspring. Thus far, however, evidence for an association between masculinity and mating/reproductive outcomes is unclear. We conducted the most comprehensive meta-analysis to date on the relationship between six types of masculine traits and mating/reproductive outcomes, comprising 474 effect sizes from 96 studies (total             N             = 177,044). Body masculinity, i.e. strength/muscularity, was the strongest and only consistent predictor of both mating and reproduction. Voice pitch, height, digit ratios, and testosterone levels all predicted mating; height and digit ratios also predicted some reproductive measures in some samples. Facial masculinity did not significantly predict either mating or reproduction. There was insufficient evidence for any effects on offspring mortality. Our findings support arguments that strength/muscularity can be considered sexually selected in humans, but raise concerns over other forms of masculinity. We are also constrained by lack of reproductive data, particularly from naturally fertile populations. Our data thus highlight the need to increase tests of evolutionary hypotheses outside of industrialized populations.},

Body masculinity, i.e. muscularity and strength, predicted both mating and reproductive success. Voice pitch, height, digit ratios and testosterone levels all predicted mating but not reproductive outcomes. Facial masculinity did not significantly predict either. Our findings support arguments that muscularity/strength can be considered sexually selected in humans, but raise concerns over other forms of masculinity, most especially facial masculinity. We are also constrained by lack of reproductive data, particularly from naturally fertile populations. Our data thus highlight the need to increase tests of evolutionary hypotheses outside of industrialised populations.},

Sexual selection hypotheses posit that, ancestrally, more `masculine' men may have acquired more mates and/or sired more viable offspring. Thus far, however, evidence for either association is unclear. Here, we meta-analyze the relationships between six masculine traits and mating/reproductive outcomes (96 studies, 474 effects, N = 177,044). Voice pitch, height, and testosterone all predicted mating; however, strength/muscularity was the strongest and only consistent predictor of both mating and reproduction. Facial masculinity and digit ratios did not significantly predict either. There was no clear evidence for any effects of masculinity on offspring viability. Our findings support arguments that strength/muscularity may be sexually selected in humans, but cast doubt regarding selection for other forms of masculinity and highlight the need to increase tests of evolutionary hypotheses outside of industrialized populations.},

Among over 300 bacterial taxa targeted by the HOMIM microarray, Slackia exigua was detected only in infants delivered by C-section. Further, significantly more bacterial taxa were detected in the infants delivered vaginally (79 species/species clusters) compared with infants delivered by C-section (54 species/ species clusters). Multivariate modeling revealed a strong model that separated the microbiota of C-section and vaginally delivered infants into two distinct colonization patterns. In conclusion, our study indicated differences in the oral microbiota in infants due to mode of delivery, with vaginally delivered infants having a higher number of taxa detected by the HOMIM microarray.},

Current evolutionary theories argue that decision-makers evaluate and respond to this information based on context cues, such as prestige (the prestige bias model; PBM), and/or incentives (the risk and incentives model; RIM). We tested the roles of each in explaining trust using a preregistered vignette-based study involving advice about livestock among Maasai pastoralists. In exploratory analyses, we also investigated how the relevance of each might be influenced by recent cultural and economic changes, such as market integration and shifting cultural values. In our confirmatory analysis we found no support for the PBM, and partial support for the RIM. Exploratory analyses suggested that regional acculturation varied strongly between northern vs. southern areas, divided by a small mountain. Consistent with the idea that trust varies with socially transmitted values and regional differences in market integration, people living near densely populated towns in the southern region were more likely to trust socially learned information about livestock. Higher trust among market-integrated participants might reflect a coordination solution, in a region where traditional pastoralism is beset with novel conflicts of interest.},

Methods Data came from the 2013 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). All adults endorsing past year cannabis use who reported living in a state that had legalized medical cannabis were divided into recreational cannabis use only and medical cannabis use. Demographic and clinical characteristics were compared across these two groups. Results 17\% of adults who used cannabis in the past year used cannabis medically. There were no significant differences between those who used medically versus recreationally in race, education, past year depression and prevalence of cannabis use disorders. In adjusted analyses, those with medical cannabis use were more likely to have poorer health and lower levels of alcohol use disorders and non-cannabis drug use. A third of those who reported medical cannabis use endorsed daily cannabis use compared to 11\% in those who reported recreational use exclusively. Conclusions Adults who use medical and recreational cannabis shared some characteristics, but those who used medical cannabis had higher prevalence of poor health and daily cannabis use. As more states legalize cannabis for medical use, it is important to better understand similarities and differences between people who use cannabis medically and recreationally.},

Methods Of 4481 initially identified records in three electronic databases, 58 studies published 1978 to 2021 were included for meta-analysis. Results (1) Association of depression and gender role is moderated by study year and human development indices. (2) Masculinity is a protective factor for depression, while this dominance has declined as life expectancy increases. (3) A negative, weak but significant association between depression and femininity is observed in women, and college students, which starts to emerge with the gradual increase in the national education and income index from 1990 to 2019. (4) Androgynous individuals reported the lowest level of depression as compared with other gender role orientations (masculine, feminine, and undifferentiated trait group). This disparity is becoming more extreme with life expectancy and per capita income index increases. Limitations English-language studies were only included in this review. Conclusions Androgyny might be the most ideal gender role protecting both women and men from depression.},

  abstract = {Objectives To examine the relation between health and several dimensions of sexuality and to estimate years of sexually active life across sex and health groups in middle aged and older adults. Design Cross sectional study. Setting Two samples representative of the US population: MIDUS (the national survey of midlife development in the United States, 1995-6) and NSHAP (the national social life, health and ageing project, 2005-6). Participants 3032 adults aged 25 to 74 (1561 women, 1471 men) from the midlife cohort (MIDUS) and 3005 adults aged 57 to 85 (1550 women, 1455 men) from the later life cohort (NSHAP). Main outcome measures Sexual activity, quality of sexual life, interest in sex, and average remaining years of sexually active life, referred to as sexually active life expectancy. Results Overall, men were more likely than women to be sexually active, report a good quality sex life, and be interested in sex. These gender differences increased with age and were greatest among the 75 to 85 year old group: 38.9\% of men compared with 16.8\% of women were sexually active, 70.8\% versus 50.9\% of those who were sexually active had a good quality sex life, and 41.2\% versus 11.4\% were interested in sex. Men and women reporting very good or excellent health were more likely to be sexually active compared with their peers in poor or fair health: age adjusted odds ratio 2.2 (P{$<$}0.01) for men and 1.6 (P{$<$}0.05) for women in the midlife study and 4.6 (P{$<$}0.001) for men and 2.8 (P{$<$}0.001) for women in the later life study. Among sexually active people, good health was also significantly associated with frequent sex (once or more weekly) in men (adjusted odds ratio 1.6 to 2.1), with a good quality sex life among men and women in the midlife cohort (adjusted odds ratio 1.7), and with interest in sex. People in very good or excellent health were 1.5 to 1.8 times more likely to report an interest in sex than those in poorer health. At age 30, sexually active life expectancy was 34.7 years for men and 30.7 years for women compared with 14.9 to 15.3 years for men and 10.6 years for women at age 55. This gender disparity attenuated for people with a spouse or other intimate partner. At age 55, men in very good or excellent health on average gained 5-7 years of sexually active life compared with their peers in poor or fair health. Women in very good or excellent health gained 3-6 years compared with women in poor or fair health. Conclusion Sexual activity, good quality sexual life, and interest in sex were higher for men than for women and this gender gap widened with age. Sexual activity, quality of sexual life, and interest in sex were positively associated with health in middle age and later life. Sexually active life expectancy was longer for men, but men lost more years of sexually active life as a result of poor health than women.},

Where it occurs, such an identification reflects a local preference for the articulation of individual psychological notions, rather than universal moral imperatives. While the symptoms of reactive depression are recognized in rural Trinidad as a common experience, but not especially remarked, they are also identified by Afro-Caribbeans as a specific state, Tabanka, following the loss of a sexual partner to another. Tabanka is characterized by lassitude, anorexia, insomnia, feelings of worthlessness, anger, a loss of interest in work and other activities and, especially, by a preoccupation with the faithless one. It is said to be most common among married men and among the upwardly socially mobile, and to lead to heavy drinking and occasionally madness or suicide. The precipitation of Tabanka provokes hilarity rather than moral indignation, and its humour articulates an egalitarian and individualistic working-class attitude to marriage and social mobility. In contrast, Trinidadians of Asian or Venezuelan origin emphasize moral notions of honour and shame.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: We use multilevel modeling (MLM) to parse out the effects of time-varying smoking abstinence and baseline depression (history and severity) on depression severity over one year. METHODS: Participants were 1,000 smokers recruited worldwide for an online randomized controlled tobacco cessation trial. We examined whether changes in depression severity over time were associated with self-reported 7-day point prevalence smoking status assessed at 1-,3-,6-, and 12-month follow-up using baseline major depressive episode (MDE) history and baseline depression severity as time-invariant covariates. We present depression severity means and smoking abstinence at each follow-up. RESULTS: Regardless of concurrent abstinence status, baseline MDE history was significantly related to depression severity over time: those reporting a past MDE had worse depressive symptoms over time compared with those reporting no MDE history. Baseline depression severity interacted significantly with time-varying abstinence status: for every 1-unit increase in baseline scores on the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), individuals who were smoking at follow-up reported CES-D scores that were 0.17 points higher than those who were abstinent. In this context, nicotine dependence, gender, age, or marital status did not affect depression severity. CONCLUSIONS: In the context of cessation, having an MDE history plays a significant role in the trajectory of depression severity over the course of one year, regardless of abstinence status. Abstinence is related to lower depressive symptoms at each follow-up, and this effect was stronger at higher levels of baseline depression severity. IMPLICATIONS: This study indicates that depressive symptoms are not exacerbated among individuals who are quitting smoking at 1-, 3-, 6- and 12-month follow-ups. Depression severity is worse with a baseline history of major depressive episode. Further, those with high baseline depression severity who continue smoking have worse depressive symptoms throughout a one-year period compared to their abstinent counterparts.},

Perception of the inner light can be comprehended as resonance. Uncovering the inner energy optimizes physiological and mental health. In the meditation experiment, a significant correlation was observed between perception of the inner light and electroencephalographic (EEG) alpha blockage. We further examined this phenomenon by recording the EEG from subjects during a blessing that the subjects did not know being given. During the blessing period, significant alpha blocking was observed in experimental subjects who had been practicing meditation for years in preparation for being in resonance with the inner light.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The role of muscular fitness (as a protecting factor for an optimal immune system) and WBC count remains unclear. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the relationship between the total count of WBC and groups based on handgrip strength and body composition. The aim of this study was to elucidate the relationship between handgrip strength and WBC count in a nationally representative sample of adolescents from the U.S. METHODS: We used data from the NHANES cross-sectional study (waves 2011 to 2014). The final analysis included 917 adolescents from 12-17 years old (51.0\% boys). Normalized handgrip strength (kg) (NHS) was relativized by body composition parameters (body weight [NHSw], total body fat [NHSf], and trunk fat [NHSt]) assessed with dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. RESULTS: An inverse association was found between total WBC count and all assessments of low NHS in both sexes (p {$<$} 0.05). Both boys and girls with low NHS had higher WBC counts in all estimations of NHS than those with high NHS (p {$<$} 0.05 for all). All estimations of low NHS showed significant differences with those with intermediate NHS (only in girls) (p {$<$} 0.05 for all). Girls with intermediate NHSt exhibited higher WBC count than those with high NHSt (p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that greater levels of NHS are linked to lower total WBC counts. From a public health perspective, our findings are clinically significant and emphasize the relevance of improving muscular fitness during adolescence since it may contribute to boosting the immune system among adolescents.},

A potential source of error in publicly available data that may affect the accuracy of ecological niche models (ENMs), and one that is difficult to correct for, is incorrect (or incomplete) taxonomy. Here we remind researchers of the need for careful evaluation of database records prior to use in modelling, especially when the presence of cryptic species is suspected or many records are based on indirect evidence. To draw attention to this potential problem, we construct ENMs for the North American Sasquatch (i.e. Bigfoot). Specifically, we use a large database of georeferenced putative sightings and footprints for Sasquatch in western North America, demonstrating how convincing environmentally predicted distributions of a taxon's potential range can be generated from questionable site-occurrence data. We compare the distribution of Bigfoot with an ENM for the black bear, Ursus americanus, and suggest that many sightings of this cryptozoid may be cases of mistaken identity.},

On the basis of extensive interviews with patients and doctors, as well as day-to-day investigative fieldwork in residency programs, private psychiatric hospitals, and state hospitals, Luhrmann shows us how psychiatrists are trained, how they develop their particular way of seeing and listening to their patients, what makes a psychiatrist successful, and how the enormous ambiguities in the field affect its practitioners and patients.How do psychiatrists learn to do what they do? What is it like for psychiatrists to deal with people who are in emotional extremity? How does the choice between drug therapy and talk therapy, each of which requires very different skills, affect the way psychiatrists understand their patients?~~Boldly and with sharp insight, Luhrmann takes the reader into the world of young doctors in training.At a time when mood-altering drugs have revolutionized the treatment of the mentally ill and HMOs are forcing caregivers to take the pharmacological route, Luhrmann places us at the heart of the struggle -- do we treat people's brains or their minds? -- and allows us to see exactly what is at stake.},

  abstract = {Why are physically formidable men willingly allocated higher social status by others in cooperative groups? Ancestrally, physically formidable males would have been differentially equipped to generate benefits for groups by providing leadership services of within-group enforcement (e.g., implementing punishment of free riders) and between-group representation (e.g., negotiating with other coalitions). Therefore, we hypothesize that adaptations for social status allocation are designed to interpret men's physical formidability as a cue to these leadership abilities, and to allocate greater status to formidable men on this basis. These hypotheses were supported in 4 empirical studies wherein young adults rated standardized photos of subjects (targets) who were described as being part of a white-collar business consultancy. In Studies 1 and 2, male targets' physical strength positively predicted ratings of their projected status within the organization, and this effect was mediated by perceptions that stronger men possessed greater leadership abilities of within-group enforcement and between-group representation. Moreover, (a) these same patterns held whether status was conceptualized as overall ascendancy, prestige-based status, or dominance-based status, and (b) strong men who were perceived as aggressively self-interested were not allocated greater status. Finally, 2 experiments established the causality of physical formidability's effects on status-related perceptions by manipulating targets' relative strength (Study 3) and height (Study 4). In interpreting our findings, we argue that adaptations for formidability-based status allocation may have facilitated the evolution of group cooperation in humans and other primates.

We advance a novel explanation for personality covariation, which views trait covariance as being shaped within a particular socioecology. We hypothesize that the degree of personality covariation observed within a society will be inversely related to the society's socioecological complexity, that is, its diversity of social and occupational niches. Using personality survey data from participant samples in 55 nations (N = 17,637), we demonstrate that the Big Five dimensions are more strongly intercorrelated in less complex societies, where the complexity is indexed by nation-level measures of economic development, urbanization, and sectoral diversity. This inverse relationship is robust to control variables accounting for a number of methodological and response biases. Our findings support the socioecological complexity hypothesis and more generally bolster functionalist accounts of trait covariation.},

  abstract = {[Target Article.] Objectives: Sexual selection typically centers on bodily and psychological traits. Non-bodily traits ranging from housing and vehicles through art to social media can, however, influence sexual selection even in absence of the phenotype proper. The theoretical framework of human sexual selection is updated in this article by unifying four theoretical approaches and conceptualizing non-bodily traits as extended phenotypic traits. Methods: Existing research is synthesized with extended phenotype theory, life history theory, and behavioral ecology. To test population-level hypotheses arising from the review, ecological and demographic data on 122 countries are analyzed with multiple linear regression modelling. Results: A four-factor model of intelligence, adolescent fertility, population density, and atmospheric cold demands predicts 64\% of global variation in economic complexity in 1995 and 72\% of the variation in 2016. Conclusions: The evolutionary pathways of extended phenotypes frequently undergo a categorical broadening from providing functional benefits to carrying signalling value. Extended phenotypes require investments in skills and bioenergetic resources, but they can improve survival in high latitudes, facilitate the extraction of resources from the environment, and substantially influence sexual selection outcomes. Bioenergetic investments in extended phenotypes create individual- and population-level tradeoffs with competing life history processes, exemplified here as a global tradeoff between adolescent fertility and economic complexity. The merits of the present model include a more systematic classification of sexual traits, a clearer articulation of their evolutionary-developmental hierarchy, and an analysis of ecological, genetic, and psychological mechanisms that modulate the flow of energy into extended phenotypes and cultural innovations.},

Breast feeding is associated with improved infant health and immune development, less incidences of gastrointestinal disease and lower mortality rates than formula fed infants. As well as providing fundamental nutrients to the growing infant, breast milk is a source of commensal bacteria which further enhance infant health by preventing pathogen adhesion and promoting gut colonisation of beneficial microbes. While breast milk was initially considered a sterile fluid and microbes isolated were considered contaminants, it is now widely accepted that breast milk is home to its own unique microbiome. The origins of bacteria in breast milk have been subject to much debate, however, the possibility of an entero-mammary pathway allowing for transfer of microbes from maternal gut to the mammary gland is one potential pathway. Human milk derived strains can be regarded as potential probiotics; therefore, many studies have focused on isolating strains from milk for subsequent use in infant health and nutrition markets. This review aims to discuss mammary gland development in preparation for lactation as well as explore the microbial composition and origins of the human milk microbiota with a focus on probiotic development.},

A series of laboratory experiments was performed to test agreement between urine concentrations, or results, before and after passage through a UCP (incubated for 37\textdegree C for 15~min). The following urinalyses were performed: electrolytes, calcium, phosphate, urate, osmolality, pH, protein, catecholamines, toxicology for drugs of abuse, stick urinalysis for glucose, ketones, protein, blood, leucocytes and nitrites, and microscopy for red and white cells. Close agreement was shown for all laboratory analyses except proteinuria, which was underestimated by, on average, 10\% after UCP passage. However, stick urinalysis for proteinuria remains sufficiently reliable for clinical use. UCP substantially retain or destroy red and white cells, but stick urinalysis for blood and leucocyte esterase remains reliable. In conclusion, urine samples derived from UCP show good agreement across a clinically relevant range for the biochemical analyses undertaken in this study. Microscopy of UCP samples is unreliable for cellular material but semi-quantitative stick urinalysis for red and white cells is a satisfactory alternative.},

  abstract = {It has long been claimed that ``maltreatment begets maltreatment,'' that is, a parent's history of maltreatment increases the risk that his or her child will also suffer maltreatment. However, significant methodological concerns have been raised regarding evidence supporting this assertion, with some arguing that the association weakens in samples with higher methodological rigor. In the current study, the intergenerational transmission of maltreatment hypothesis is examined in 142 studies (149 samples; 227,918 dyads) that underwent a methodological quality review, as well as data extraction on a number of potential moderator variables. Results reveal a modest association of intergenerational maltreatment (k {$\frac{1}{4}$} 80; d {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.45, 95\% confidence interval; CI [0.37, 0.54]). Support for the intergenerational transmission of specific maltreatment types was also observed (neglect: k {$\frac{1}{4}$} 13, d {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.24, 95\% CI [0.11, 0.37]; physical abuse: k {$\frac{1}{4}$} 61, d {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.41, 95\% CI [0.33, 0.49]; emotional abuse: k {$\frac{1}{4}$} 18, d {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.57, 95\% CI [0.43, 0.71]; sexual abuse: k {$\frac{1}{4}$} 18, d {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.39, 95\% CI [0.24, 0.55]). Methodological quality only emerged as a significant moderator of the intergenerational transmission of physical abuse, with a weakening of effect sizes as methodological rigor increased. Evidence from this meta-analysis confirms the cycle of maltreatment hypothesis, although effect sizes were modest. Future research should focus on deepening understanding of mechanisms of transmission, as well as identifying protective factors that can effectively break the cycle of maltreatment.},

  abstract = {The first findings that depression is characterized by cell-mediated immune activation and inflammation were published between 1990\textendash 1993 (Maes et al.). Recently, it was reported that \textendash{} based on meta-analysis results \textendash{} depression is an inflammatory disorder because the plasma levels of two cytokines are increased, i.e. interleukin-(IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor-{$\alpha$} (TNF{$\alpha$}). The same meta-analysis found that plasma IL-2 and interferon-(IFN){$\gamma$} levels are not altered in depression, suggesting that there is no T cell activation in that illness. The present paper reviews the body of evidence that depression is accompanied by cell-mediated immune activation. The findings include: increased serum levels of the soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R) and the sCD8 molecule; increased numbers and percentages of T cells bearing T cell activation markers, such as CD2+CD25+, CD3+CD25+, and HLA-DR+; increased stimulated production of IFN{$\gamma$}; higher neopterin and sTNFR-1 or sTNFR-2 levels; induction of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) with lowered levels of plasma tryptophan and increased levels of tryptophan catabolites along the IDO pathway (TRYCATs); and glucocorticoid resistance in immune cells. Interferon-{$\alpha$} (IFN{$\alpha$})-based immunotherapy shows that baseline and IFN{$\alpha$}-induced activation of T cells, IDO activity and TRYCAT formation are related to the development of IFN{$\alpha$}-induced depressive symptoms. Animal models of depression show that a cell-mediated immune response is related to the development of depression-like behavior. Antidepressants and mood stabilizers suppress different aspects of cell-mediated immunity and rather specifically target IFN{$\gamma$} production. This review shows that inflammation and cell-mediated immune activation are key factors in depression.},

Situation-symptom congruence hypotheses were tested in this study using experience sampling methodology. Methods Two hundred and sixty-five individuals, including 54\% who scored at least 16 on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Revised Depression Scale, responded to text prompts daily for up to 9 days, reporting depressive symptoms as well as the most stressful event or issue they had experienced or focused on within the past 24~h. Results Multilevel modeling analyses indicated that the relationships between stressors and depressive symptom patterns were largely consistent with SSCH predictions. All stressors were significantly associated with symptoms hypothesized to be adaptive in response to those stressors. Moreover, in separate analyses, nine of the ten symptoms examined were either predicted by the stressors hypothesized to lead to that symptom or negatively related to stressors hypothesized to not elicit those symptoms. Limitations It is unclear whether the results generalize to those diagnosed with a major depressive disorder; the study did not assess actual life events. Conclusions Findings suggest that depressive symptoms may, in part, be adaptations that have evolved through natural selection to help individuals cope with adverse situations.},

  abstract = {Bifidobacteria are considered to be one of the most important beneficial intestinal bacteria for infants, contributing to the priming of the mucosal immune system. These microbes can also be detected in mother's milk, suggesting a potential role of human milk in the colonisation of infant's gut. However, little is known about the timing of bacteria appearance in human milk, and whether human milk is the first source of inoculation. Here, we investigated whether specific strains are shared sustainably between maternal milk and infant's gut. Faecal samples and human milk were collected from 102 healthy mother-infant pairs (infant's faeces: meconium, 7, 30 days of age; mother's milk: once before delivery, colostrum, 7, 30 days after delivery). Bifidobacterial strains were isolated from these samples, and were discriminated by means of multilocus sequencing typing. No bifidobacteria were detected from human milk collected before delivery, or colostrum. Strains were isolated only from human milk samples obtained 7 days after birth or later. On the other hand, bifidobacterial strains were obtained from infant's faeces throughout the study period, sometimes as early as the first day of life (meconium). We have found that bifidobacterial species belonging to Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium breve, and Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum could be identified as monophyletic between infant's faeces and their mother's milk. These strains were confirmed to be sustainably shared between maternal milk and infant's gut. Moreover, monophyletic strains were isolated at the same time point or earlier from infant's faeces than from human milk, and none were isolated earlier from human milk than from infant's faeces. Although it remains unclear whether human milk is the first source of microbes for infants, our results confirm that human milk is a reservoir of bifidobacteria, and specific strains are shared between infant's intestine and human milk during breastfeeding.},

A growing number of studies have tried to investigate the underlying mechanisms of MDD by analysing the expression levels of genes (mRNA) involved in such biological processes. In this review, I have highlighted a possible key role that gene expression might play in the treatment of MDD. This is critical because many patients do not respond to antidepressant treatment or can experience side effects, causing treatment to be interrupted. Unfortunately, selecting the best antidepressant for each individual is still largely a matter of making an informed guess.},

Methods: A voluntary, anonymous survey regarding patterns of use of cannabis and views on legalization was distributed to a convenience sample of pregnant women presenting for prenatal care at an outpatient university clinic. Chi-square and Fischer's exact tests were used for analysis using STATA. Results: Of 306 surveys returned, 35\% of women reported currently using cannabis at the time of diagnosis of pregnancy and 34\% of those women continued to use. Seventy percent of respondents endorsed the belief that cannabis could be harmful to a pregnancy. Fifty-nine percent of respondents believed that cannabis should be legalized in some form and 10\% reported that they would use cannabis more during pregnancy if it were legalized. Those who continued to use cannabis during pregnancy were less likely than those who quit to believe that cannabis use could be harmful during pregnancy (26\% vs 75\%, P {$<$} 0.001). The most common motivation for quitting cannabis use in pregnancy was to avoid being a bad example (74\%); in comparison, only 27\% of respondents listed a doctor's recommendation as a motivation to quit. Conclusions: Cannabis use during pregnancy is relatively common and persistent, despite knowledge of the potential risks of harm. Views toward legalization vary among pregnant women and may impact cannabis use during pregnancy. In a changing legal climate, there is a need for clear messaging on the effects of cannabis use during pregnancy.}

Analyses indicated that attractive body parts were distributed normally with the peak shifted to moderately supernormal sizes, while unattractive body parts had mostly U-shaped or skewed distributions with extremes in super-supernormal and/or subnormal sizes. Generally, both male and female attractive bodies had prominent ``sporty'' look: supernormally wide shoulders and long legs. Gender differences showed that men prefer more supernomal masculine and feminine sizes, while women show an ambivalence toward both groups of traits. Principal components analysis revealed gender differences on the multitrait level: males focus on prominent masculine and feminine traits, while women focus on traits that make both male and female bodies more elongated and slender. Gender differences were in line with specific male and female positions in the partner selection process, while a certain tendency toward masculinization of the female body required the inclusion of social factors, such as the influence of the culture of a sporty and fit look.},

  abstract = {The aim was to systematically review the relationship between muscular strength (MS) and depression symptoms (DS) among adults, and conduct a meta-analysis to determine the pooled odds ratio (OR) for the relationship between MS and DS. The strategies employed in this systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Studies published up to December 2019 were systematically identified by searching in the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science electronic databases. Inclusion criteria were: (1) cross-sectional, longitudinal and intervention studies; (2) outcomes included depression or DS; (3) participants were adults and older adults; and (4) the articles were published in English, French, Portuguese, or Spanish. A total of 21 studies were included in the review, totalling 87,508 adults aged {$\geq$}18 years, from 26 countries. The systematic review findings suggest that MS has a positive effect on reducing DS. Meta-analysis findings indicate that MS is inversely and significantly related to DS 0.85 (95\% CI: 0.80, 0.89). Interventions aiming to improve MS have the potential to promote mental health and prevent depression. Thus, public health professionals could use MS assessment and improvement as a strategy to promote mental health and prevent depression.},

  abstract = {Six months of exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) is considered optimal for infant health, though globally most infants begin complementary feeding (CF) earlier\textemdash including among populations that practice prolonged breastfeeding. Two frameworks for understanding patterns of early CF emerge in the literature. In the first, maternal and infant needs trade-off, as ``maternal-centric'' factors\textemdash related to time and energy demands, reproductive investment, cultural influences, and structural barriers\textemdash{} favor supplanting breastfeeding with earlier and increased CF. A second framework considers that ``infant-centric'' factors\textemdash related to infant energetic needs\textemdash favor CF before six months to supplement breastfeeding. We apply these two frameworks in examining early CF among the Tsimane\textemdash a high-fertility, high-mortality, forager-horticulturalist population residing in the Bolivian Amazon. Data were collected from a mixed-longitudinal sample of 161 Tsimane mother-infant pairs from August 2012\textendash April 2013. Tsimane mothers generally reported introducing CF because of perceived infant needs. However, CF is introduced with continued intensive breastfeeding, and generally coupled with premastication. Risks of earlier CF relative to the minimum hazard (estimated at 5 births) were elevated for lower and higher parity mothers, but were significantly greater only after 9 births. Seventeen percent of mothers reported introducing CF because of low milk supply. Introducing CF because of low milk was most common from 0 to 3 months of age and among higher parity mothers, which may reflect physiological constraints. Maternal reproductive trade-offs and perceived infant needs may help explain the low prevalence of EBF to six months among other populations in which breastfeeding is not structurally or culturally constrained.},

However, there has been limited research on COVID-19 outcomes in exposed infants beyond the neonatal period. Between June 2020 \textendash{} March 2021, we conducted interviews and collected capillary dried blood spots from 46 SARS-CoV-2 infected mothers and their infants (aged 1-36 months) for up to two months following maternal infection onset (COVID+ group, 87\% breastfeeding). Comparative data were also collected from 26 breastfeeding mothers with no known SARS-CoV-2 infection or exposures (breastfeeding control group), and 11 mothers who tested SARS-CoV-2 negative after experiencing symptoms or close contact exposure (COVID- group, 73\% breastfeeding). Dried blood spots were assayed for anti-SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD IgG and IgA positivity and anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 + S2 IgG concentrations. Within the COVID+ group, the mean probability of seropositivity among infant samples was lower than that of corresponding maternal samples (0.54 and 0.87, respectively, for IgG; 0.33 and 0.85, respectively, for IgA), with likelihood of infant infection positively associated with the number of maternal symptoms and other household infections reported. COVID+ mothers reported a lower incidence of COVID-19 symptoms among their infants as compared to themselves and other household adults, and infants had similar PCR positivity rates as other household children. No samples returned by COVID- mothers or their infants~tested antibody positive. Among the breastfeeding control group, 44\% of mothers but none of their infants tested antibody positive in at least one~sample.

  abstract = {Background The role of structural gender inequality in macro-level differences in women's perinatal mental health remains largely unexplored. This short communication explores structural gender inequalities and their potential as a macro-level, upstream social determinant of postpartum depression (PPD). Methods We compiled meta-analytically derived national-level prevalence estimates of PPD symptoms \textendash{} based on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale \textendash{} with economic (e.g., income inequality), health (e.g., infant mortality rate), sociodemographic (e.g., urban population), and structural gender inequality variables (e.g., abortion policies) for 40 countries. Meta-regression techniques and traditional p-value based stepwise procedures, complemented with a Bayesian model averaging approach, were used for a robust selection of variables associated with national-level PPD symptom prevalence. Results Income inequality ({$\beta~$}=~0.04, 95\% CI~=~0.02 to 0.07) and abortion policies ({$\beta~$}=~0.02, 95\% CI~=~0.00 to 0.03) were the only variables selected in the final, adjusted model, accounting for 60.7\% of cross-national variations in PPD symptoms. Limitations Study quality of primary studies was not assessed and some national-level meta-analytical estimates were based on few primary studies. A fifth of world countries and territories could be included, with high-income regions overrepresented. High rate of missing national-level data for potential predictors of PPD. Cross-sectional analyses precludes causal inferences. Conclusions Abortion policies are a significant macro-level social determinant of PPD, and its liberalization might be associated with women's mental health at a population level. Our findings should be a relevant argument for clinicians to advocate for changing discriminatory social norms against women.},

  abstract = {The influence of biological sex differences on human health and disease, while being increasingly recognized, has long been underappreciated and underexplored. While humans of all sexes are more alike than different, there is evidence for sex differences in the most basic aspects of human biology and these differences have consequences for the etiology and pathophysiology of many diseases. In a disease like cancer, these consequences manifest in the sex biases in incidence and outcome of many cancer types. The ability to deliver precise, targeted therapies to complex cancer cases is limited by our current understanding of the underlying sex differences. Gaining a better understanding of the implications and interplay of sex differences in diseases like cancer will thus be informative for clinical practice and biological research. Here we review the evidence for a broad array of biological sex differences in humans and discuss how these differences may relate to observed sex differences in various diseases, including many cancers and specifically glioblastoma. We focus on areas of human biology that play vital roles in healthy and disease states, including metabolism, development, hormones, and the immune system, and emphasize that the intersection of sex differences in these areas should not go overlooked. We further propose that mathematical approaches can be useful for exploring the extent to which sex differences affect disease outcomes and accounting for those in the development of therapeutic strategies.},

Market integration, which creates novel opportunities in cash economies, provides a means of testing this hypothesis. Using demographic data collected from 505 households among the matrilineal and patrilineal Mosuo in 2017, we test whether market integration is associated with increased material wealth, whether increased material wealth is associated with wealth inequality, and whether being in a matrilineal vs. patrilineal kinship system alters the relationship between wealth and inequality. We find evidence that market integration, measured as distance to the nearest source of tourism and primary source of household income, is associated with increased household income and `modern' asset value. Both village-level market integration and mean asset value were associated negatively, rather than positively, with inequality, contrary to predictions. Finally, income, modern wealth and inequality were higher in matrilineal communities that were located closer to the centre of tourism and where tourism has long provided a relatively stable source of income. However, we also observed exacerbated inequality with increasing farm animal value in patriliny. We conclude that the forces affecting wealth and inequality depend on local context and that the importance of local institutions is obscured by aggregate statistics drawn from modern nation states.},

This article begins by reviewing medical and feminist theories, highlighting their contributions to our understanding of postnatal depression as well as their limitations. In particular, clinical studies have focused on the individual mother and her circumstances, while feminist theories have emphasized the sociopolitical context at the expense of the individual. This article argues that a relational approach, which takes `relationship' as a unit of analysis, and explores women's feelings in terms of their relationships to themselves, their interpersonal relationships, and their varying relationships to cultural and structural opportunities and constraints, provides a fruitful way of understanding postnatal depression. The article discusses a qualitative study of 18 women's experiences which aimed to develop such an understanding of postnatal depression. Drawing on feminist and relational methodology and theory, the study sought to explore and prioritize women's own understandings and accounts of their experiences; elucidate the processes through which the women became depressed; and understand postnatal depression in terms of the similarities and differences between the women and their lives.},

Currently, almost 8\% of youth aged 4 to 17 years have a diagnosis of ADHD, and approximately 4.5\% both have the diagnosis and are using a stimulant (methylphenidate or amphetamine) as treatment for the disorder. Yet a diagnosis of ADHD is not simply a private medical finding; it carries with it a host of policy ramifications. The enduring controversy over ADHD in the public arena therefore reflects the discomfort over what happens when science is translated into policies and rules that govern how children will be treated medically, educationally, and legally. This article (1) summarizes the existing knowledge of ADHD, (2) provides the relevant history and trends, (3) explains the controversy, (4) discusses what is and is not unique about ADHD and stimulant pharmacotherapy, (5) outlines future directions of research, and (6) concludes with a brief analysis of how two North Carolina counties have established community protocols that have improved the screening, treatment, and societal consensus over ADHD and stimulants.},

The paper extends arguments used by Maynard Smith \& Price (1973) showing that ritualized behaviour can evolve by individual selection. The concept of an evolutionarily stable strategy, or ESS, is defined. Two types of ritualized contests are distinguished, ``tournaments'' and ``displays''; the latter, defined as contests without physical contact in which victory goes to the contestant which continues longer, are analyzed in detail. Three main conclusions are drawn. The degree of persistence should be very variable, either between individuals or for the same individual at different times; a negative exponential distribution of persistence times is predicted. Individuals should display with constant intensity, independent of how much longer they will in fact continue. An initial asymmetry in the conditions of a contest can be used to settle it, even if it is irrelevant to the outcome of a more protracted conflict if one were to take place.},

The authors, one a theoretician the other a fieldworker, introduce a sense of order to this chaos. A significant cause of confusion has been the tendency for different researchers to use either the same term with different meanings, or different terms with the same meaning. The authors attempt to clarify these differences. A second cause of confusion has arisen because many biologists continue to assume that there is only one correct explanation for signal reliability. The authors argue that the reliability of signals is maintained in several ways, relevant in different circumstances, and that biologists must learn to distinguish between them. In this book they explain the different theories, give examples of signalling systems to which one or another theory applies, and point to the many areas where further work, both theoretical and empirical, is required.},

Study Design: Data gathered at routine 4-week postnatal visits were obtained from the patient records of 209 women who gave birth between June 1, 2001, and June 1, 2003, at three university medical clinics in Tulsa, Okla. Inclusion criteria required that the records of potential study subjects contain data on the characteristics noted as well as patientcompleted Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale forms. Results: Formula feeding in place of breastfeeding, a history of depression, and cigarette smoking were all significant risk factors for an Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale score of 13 or higher, indicating probable postpartum depression. Conclusion: The authors' findings corroborate the results of previous investigators. To facilitate prophylactic patient education and intervention strategies, a larger study is recommended to determine risk factors for postpartum depression.},

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine sex-related differences in cross-sectional and prospective associations between grip strength and depressive symptoms and status. Participants were community dwelling adults (N\,=\,4505; 56.5\% female), aged {$\geq$}50\,years. As a measure of muscular strength, grip strength (kg) of the dominant hand was assessed using a hand-held dynamometer at baseline. Participants were divided into sex-specific tertiles. The Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale assessed depressive symptoms at baseline and two years later; a score of {$\geq$}16 defined caseness of depression. Depressive symptoms were significantly higher among females at baseline (p\,{$<$}\,0.001). Prospective models were adjusted for age, sex, waist circumference, social class, smoking, and health status. Among males, the middle and high strength tertiles were non-significantly associated with 32.9\% (p\,=\,0.21) and 9.9\% (p\,=\,0.74) reduced odds of developing depression, respectively. Among females, the middle and high strength tertiles were non-significantly associated with 28.5\% (p\,=\,0.13) and significantly associated with 43.4\% (p\,=\,0.01) reduced odds of developing depression, respectively. In the total sample, the middle and high strength tertiles were significantly associated with 31.5\% (p\,=\,0.04) and 34.1\% (p\,=\,0.02) reduced odds of developing depression, respectively. The interaction between sex and strength was not statistically significant (p\,=\,0.25). The present findings indicated that grip strength was inversely associated with incident depression in older adults, with stronger associations observed among females than males.},

Although the importance of facial appearance in these judgments is well established, the impact of the body morphology remains unclear. Specifically, it is unknown whether experimentally varied body morphology has an impact on perception of threat in others. In two preregistered experiments (N = 250), participants made judgments of perceived threat of body stimuli of varying morphology, both in the absence (Experiment 1) and presence (Experiment 2) of facial information. Bodies were perceived as more threatening as they increased in mass with added musculature and portliness, and less threatening as they increased in emaciation. The impact of musculature endured even in the presence of faces, although faces contributed more to the overall threat judgment. The relative contributions of the faces and bodies seemed to be driven by discordance, such that threatening faces exerted the most influence when paired with non-threatening bodies, and vice versa. This suggests that the faces and bodies were not perceived as entirely independent and separate components. Overall, these findings suggest that body morphology plays an important role in perceived threat and may bias real-world judgments.},

Furthermore, little is known about what influences the infant-feeding decisions of these women.Research aim:This study aimed to describe what influences the infant-feeding decisions of women taking medication-assisted treatment for an opioid use disorder.Methods:Qualitative description was used. We conducted semistructured, individual interviews with mothers (N = 8) who were receiving medication-assisted treatment during the postpartum period. We analyzed our data using thematic analysis.Results:We identified two themes: (a) what I heard about breastfeeding, and (b) doing what I feel is best for my baby. What I heard about breastfeeding reflects the information and misinformation that women received about breastfeeding. Doing what I feel is best for my baby describes the inner conflict that the women experienced. Most of the women in this study desired to breastfeed; however, all women reported that the social stigma surrounding methadone use strongly influenced their infant-feeding decision.Conclusion:This study sheds new light on what influences the infant-feeding decisions of women taking medication-assisted treatment and represents an initial step toward the development of targeted interventions to improve breastfeeding rates for this unique population.},

We also present possible neurobiological mechanisms underlying testosterone's mostly protective benefits, including the brain regions, neural circuits, and cellular and molecular pathways involved. While the precise underlying mechanisms remain unclear, both activational and organizational effects of testosterone appear to contribute to these effects. Future clinical studies are necessary in order to better understand when and how testosterone therapy may be effective in both sexes.},

Only 53.66\% of all manuscripts included the word theory, and only 15.33\% explicitly claim to test predictions derived from theories. We interpret this to suggest that most psychological research is not driven by theory, nor can it be contributing to cumulative theory building.

Now he returns with a book that transforms our understanding of mental disorders by exploring a fundamentally new question. Instead of asking why certain people suffer from mental illness, Nesse asks why natural selection has left us all with fragile minds. ~ Drawing on revealing stories from his own clinical practice and insights from evolutionary biology, Nesse shows how negative emotions are useful in certain situations, yet can become overwhelming. Anxiety protects us from harm in the face of danger, but false alarms are inevitable. Low moods prevent us from wasting effort in pursuit of unreachable goals, but they often escalate into pathological depression. Other mental disorders, such as addiction and anorexia, result from the mismatch between modern environment and our ancient human past. And there are good evolutionary reasons for sexual disorders and for why genes for schizophrenia persist. Taken together, these and many more insights help to explain the pervasiveness of human suffering, and show us new paths for relieving it by understanding individuals as individuals.},

Additionally, as humans are cooperative breeders and, throughout our evolutionary history and today, we rear offspring within social networks, we examine associations between the social environment and the HMM. Childrearing and breastfeeding exist in a biosocial nexus, which we hypothesize influences the HMM. Methods Milk samples from hunter-gatherer and horticultural mothers (n = 41) collected over two seasons, were analyzed for their microbial composition. A subsample of these women's infants (n = 33) also participated in detailed naturalistic behavioral observations which identified the breadth of infants' social and caregiving networks and the frequency of contact they had with caregivers. Results Analyses of milk produced by CAR women indicated that HMM diversity and community composition were related to the size of the mother-infant dyad's social network and frequency of care that infants receive. The abundance of some microbial taxa also varied significantly across populations and seasons. Alpha diversity, however, was not related to subsistence type or seasonality. Conclusion While the origins of the HMM are not fully understood, our results provide evidence regarding possible feedback loops among the infant, the mother, and the mother's social network that might influence HMM composition.},

  abstract = {The current study examines country-specific risk factors of intimate partner violence (IPV) victimization among Guatemalan and Honduran women. More specifically, we examine if (in)equality between partners, experience of controlling or emotionally abusive behavior, and components of the intergenerational transmission of violence significantly affect the risk of lifetime IPV victimization for Guatemalan (N\,=\,5,645) and Honduran women (N\,=\,9,427). We address this by analyzing both the 2014 to 2015 Guatemala Demographic and Health Survey and the 2011 to 2012 Honduras Demographic and Health Survey. Results suggest that equality between partners operates differently across the two nations, which is likely related to social norms in each country. In particular, having more decisional input is a protective factor against IPV victimization for Guatemalan women. Increased educational attainment, however, is a risk factor for IPV victimization among Honduran women. Implications, especially as they pertain to social service agencies and programming, are discussed.},

Numerous studies show steep increases in psychological problems when girls reach puberty, including spikes in depression, anxiety, aggression, delinquency, self-injurious behavior, suicidality, substance use, disordered eating, school failure, and interpersonal conflict. Clinical symptoms continue to be linked with reproductive events across women's lives (e.g., the menstrual cycle, childbirth) and drop noticeably after menopause. These patterns are present cross-culturally and documented in numerous Western, industrialized countries, as well as the Middle East, Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Despite this, very few psychological scientists consider the interplay of reproductive change and mental health. In this introduction to the special series, we present a brief discussion of the associations between reproductive change and psychological symptoms, explore the underrepresentation of research on this topic within psychological science, and highlight recent developments in this field.},

One screening tool, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), which was developed for use in primary care has also gained popularity in research settings. The reliability and validity of the PHQ-9 has been well established among predominantly Caucasian samples, in addition to many minority groups. However, there is little evidence regarding its utility among Hispanic Americans, a large and growing cultural group in the United States. In this study, we investigated the reliability and structural validity of the PHQ-9 in Hispanic American women. A community sample of 479 Latina women from southern California completed the PHQ-9 in their preferred language of English or Spanish. Cronbach's alphas suggested that there was good internal consistency for both the English- and Spanish-language versions. Structural validity was investigated using multigroup confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Results support a similar one-factor structure with equivalent response patterns and variances among English- and Spanish-speaking Latinas. These results suggest that the PHQ-9 can be used with confidence in both English and Spanish versions to screen Latinas for depression.},

Culture is shown to exhibit variation, competition, inheritance, and the accumulation of successive cultural modifications over time. Adaptation, convergence, and the loss or change of function can also be identified in culture. Just as Darwin knew nothing of genes or particulate inheritance, a case for Darwinian cultural evolution can be made irrespective of whether unitary cultural replicators exist or whether cultural transmission mechanisms are well understood.},

Some researchers argue that CCE is unique to humans and underlies our extraordinary evolutionary success as a species. Others claim to have found CCE in non-human species. Yet others remain sceptical that CCE is even important for explaining human behavioural diversity and complexity. These debates are hampered by multiple and often ambiguous definitions of CCE. Here, we review how researchers define, use and test CCE. We identify a core set of criteria for CCE which are both necessary and sufficient, and may be found in non-human species. We also identify a set of extended criteria that are observed in human CCE but not, to date, in other species. Different socio-cognitive mechanisms may underlie these different criteria. We reinterpret previous theoretical models and observational and experimental studies of both human and non-human species in light of these more fine-grained criteria. Finally, we discuss key issues surrounding information, fitness and cognition. We recommend that researchers are more explicit about what components of CCE they are testing and claiming to demonstrate.},

Although the pathways of these effects are likely complex and multifactorial, recent evidence suggests that innate inflammatory processes may play a role. An overview of current literature suggests that pathways between negative moods and inflammation are bi-directional. Indeed, negative moods activate peripheral physiologic mechanisms that result in an up regulation of systemic levels of inflammation. Conversely, peripheral inflammatory mediators signal the brain to affect behavioral, affective and cognitive changes that are consistent with symptoms of major depressive disorder. It is likely that these pathways are part of a complex feedback loop that involves the nervous, endocrine, and immune systems and plays a role in the modulation of peripheral inflammatory responses to central and peripheral stimuli, in central responses to peripheral immune activation and in the maintenance of homeostatic balance. Further research is warranted to fully understand the role of central processes in this feedback loop, which likely contributes to the pathophysiology of mental and physical health.},

  abstract = {With the legalization of recreational marijuana in many states, we anticipate more women will be using and self-reporting marijuana use in pregnancy. Marijuana is the most common illicit drug used in pregnancy, with a prevalence of use ranging from 3\% to 30\% in various populations. Marijuana freely crosses the placenta and is found in breast milk. It may have adverse effects on both perinatal outcomes and fetal neurodevelopment. Specifically, marijuana may be associated with fetal growth restriction, stillbirth, and preterm birth. However, data are far from uniform regarding adverse perinatal outcomes. Existing studies are plagued by confounding by tobacco and other drug exposures as well as sociodemographic factors. In addition, there is a lack of quantification of marijuana exposure by the trimester of use and a lack of corroboration of maternal self-report with biological sampling, which contributes to the heterogeneity of study results. There is an emerging body of evidence indicating that marijuana may cause problems with neurological development, resulting in hyperactivity, poor cognitive function, and changes in dopaminergic receptors. In addition, contemporary marijuana products have higher quantities of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol than in the 1980s when much of the marijuana research was completed. The effects on the pregnancy and fetus may therefore be different than those previously seen. Further research is needed to provide evidence-based counseling of women regarding the anticipated outcomes of marijuana use in pregnancy. In the meantime, women should be advised not to use marijuana in pregnancy or while lactating.},

Marijuana crosses the placenta and passes into breastmilk, resulting in fetal and neonatal exposure. Many women cite medical reasons for prenatal marijuana use such as nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, anxiety, and chronic pain. The scientific literature regarding marijuana in pregnancy is mixed resulting in confusion among practitioners as to how to counsel women about risks of use. In addition, there is a paucity of literature related to marijuana use and breastfeeding. Existing pregnancy studies are predominantly retrospective cohorts with a reliance on self-report for ascertainment of exposure, which underestimates use. Many studies fail to adjust for important confounding factors such as tobacco use and sociodemographic differences. Despite the limitations of the existing evidence, there are animal and human data suggesting potential harms of cannabis use. The harms are biologically plausible given the role of the endocannabinoid system in pregnancy implantation, placentation, and fetal neurological development. Two recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses found an association between marijuana use and adverse perinatal outcomes, especially with heavy marijuana use. In addition, three longitudinal cohort studies demonstrate a possible effect of prenatal marijuana exposure on long-term neurobehavioral outcomes. Marijuana use may be associated with growth restriction, stillbirth, spontaneous preterm birth and neonatal intensive care unit admission. Therefore, women should be advised to refrain from using marijuana during pregnancy and lactation.},

SSRIs bind to the serotonin transporter (SERT), blocking the reabsorption of serotonin by the presynaptic neuron and increasing serotonin levels in the synaptic cleft. The serotonergic system regulates a range of brain development processes including neuronal proliferation, migration, differentiation and synaptogenesis. Given the presence of SERT in early brain development, coupled with the ability of SSRIs to cross the placenta and also enter breast milk, concerns have been raised regarding the effects of SSRI exposure on the developing foetus and newborns. In this review, we evaluate preclinical and clinical studies that have examined the effects of maternal SSRI exposure and the risk for altered neurodevelopment and associated behaviours in offspring. While the current body of evidence suggests that maternal SSRI treatment may cause perturbations to the neurobiology, behaviour and ultimately risk for neurodevelopmental disorders in exposed offspring, conflicting findings do exist and the evidence is not conclusive. However, given the increasing incidence of depression and number of women prescribed ADDs during pregnancy, further investigation into this area is warranted.},

The most compelling data come from studies of children raised in poverty or maltreated by their parents, who show heightened vulnerability to vascular disease, autoimmune disorders, and premature mortality. These findings raise challenging theoretical questions. How does childhood stress get under the skin, at the molecular level, to affect risk for later diseases? And how does it incubate there, giving rise to diseases several decades later? Here we present a biological embedding model, which attempts to address these questions by synthesizing knowledge across several behavioral and biomedical literatures. This model maintains that childhood stress gets ``programmed'' into macrophages through epigenetic markings, posttranslational modifications, and tissue remodeling. As a consequence these cells are endowed with proinflammatory tendencies, manifest in exaggerated cytokine responses to challenge and decreased sensitivity to inhibitory hormonal signals. The model goes on to propose that over the life course, these proinflammatory tendencies are exacerbated by behavioral proclivities and hormonal dysregulation, themselves the products of exposure to early stress. Behaviorally, the model posits that childhood stress gives rise to excessive threat vigilance, mistrust of others, poor social relationships, impaired self-regulation, and unhealthy lifestyle choices. Hormonally, early stress confers altered patterns of endocrine and autonomic discharge. This milieu amplifies the proinflammatory environment already instantiated by macrophages. Acting in concert with other exposures and genetic liabilities, the resulting inflammation drives forward pathogenic mechanisms that ultimately foster chronic disease.},

In this report, we describe and validate a highly sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for quantifying IL-6 at low concentrations in samples of capillary whole blood collected from a simple finger stick and dried on filter paper (dried blood spots, DBS). Methods A commercially available ELISA for IL-6 was modified to develop a protocol for the quantification of IL-6 in DBS samples. Procedures for sample elution and incubation were optimized for precision, reliability, accuracy, and lower limit of detection using small volumes of DBS. A set of 46 matched serum/DBS samples were used to evaluate agreement between serum and DBS results. Results The protocol demonstrated acceptable levels of precision, reliability, accuracy and agreement with serum-based results. The lower limit of detection was sufficiently low to measure levels of IL-6 associated with both chronic, low-grade inflammation and acute increases in inflammatory activity. Conclusions This protocol adds to the growing panel of analytes validated for quantification in DBS samples and should facilitate future research on the causes and consequences of inflammation in diverse non-clinical settings.},

In addition, cognitive attributes of functional and dysfunctional impulsivity have not yet been identified. The present study addressed these issues by examining the inter-relationships between impulsivity measured using the delay discounting task and self-report questionnaires, alongside a measure of cognitive distortions. The results showed that delay discount rates were positively correlated with both functional and dysfunctional impulsivity measures, non-planning-impulsiveness and total scores of the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11). These findings are consistent with the idea that discounting the value of delayed rewards may be related to some, not necessarily dysfunctional, forms of impulsive behaviour. Furthermore, the present study suggests that negative cognitive attributes may operate as cognitive processing associated with some subtypes of impulsivity, i.e., dysfunctional impulsivity, non-planning and cognitive impulsiveness.},

One hundred and fifteen healthy participants (69 female) completed this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial in which participants were randomly assigned to receive either a single infusion of low-dose endotoxin (derived from Escherichia coli; 0.8\,ng/kg of body weight) or placebo (same volume of 0.9\% saline). Interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-{$\alpha$} (TNF-{$\alpha$}), depressed mood, and feelings of social disconnection were assessed hourly. Results showed that endotoxin (vs placebo) led to increases in proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-{$\alpha$}, IL-6), depressed mood, and feelings of social disconnection. Females exposed to endotoxin showed greater increases in depressed mood and feelings of social disconnection. Furthermore, increases in TNF-{$\alpha$} and IL-6 were correlated with increases in social disconnection for females but not for males.

  abstract = {The present paper analyses the functions of the mental health system in relation to the economic organisation of society, using concepts derived from Marx's work on political economy and building on previous critiques. The analysis starts from the position that mental health problems are not equivalent to physical, medical conditions and are more fruitfully viewed as problems of communities or societies. Using the example of the United Kingdom, it traces how a public mental health system evolved alongside capitalism in order to manage the problems posed by people whose behaviour was too chaotic, disruptive or inefficient to participate in a labour market based on exploitation. The system provided a mixture of care and control, and under recent, Neoliberal regimes, these functions have been increasingly transferred to the private sector and provided in a capitalistic manner. Welfare payments are also part of the system and support those less seriously affected but unable to work productively enough to generate surplus value and profit. The increased intensity and precarity of work under Neoliberalism has driven up benefit claims at the same time as the Neoliberal state is trying to reduce them. These social responses are legitimised by the idea that mental disorders are medical conditions, and this idea also has a hegemonic function by construing the adverse consequences of social and economic structures as individual problems, an approach that has been particularly important during the rise of Neoliberalism. The concept of mental illness has a strategic role in modern societies, therefore, enabling certain contentious social activities by obscuring their political nature, and diverting attention from the failings of the underlying economic system. The analysis suggests the medical view is driven by political imperatives rather than science and reveals the need for a system that is more transparent and democratic. While the mental health system has some consistent functions across all modern societies, this account highlights one of the endemic contradictions of the capitalist system in the way that it marginalises large groups of people by narrowing the opportunities to make an economic contribution to society.},

We aimed to synthesise and evaluate evidence on whether depression is associated with lowered serotonin concentration or activity in a systematic umbrella review of the principal relevant areas of research. PubMed, EMBASE and PsycINFO were searched using terms appropriate to each area of research, from their inception until December 2020. Systematic reviews, meta-analyses and large data-set analyses in the following areas were identified: serotonin and serotonin metabolite, 5-HIAA, concentrations in body fluids; serotonin 5-HT               1A               receptor binding; serotonin transporter (SERT) levels measured by imaging or at post-mortem; tryptophan depletion studies; SERT gene associations and SERT gene-environment interactions. Studies of depression associated with physical conditions and specific subtypes of depression (e.g. bipolar depression) were excluded. Two independent reviewers extracted the data and assessed the quality of included studies using the AMSTAR-2, an adapted AMSTAR-2, or the STREGA for a large genetic study. The certainty of study results was assessed using a modified version of the GRADE. We did not synthesise results of individual meta-analyses because they included overlapping studies. The review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020207203). 17 studies were included: 12 systematic reviews and meta-analyses, 1 collaborative meta-analysis, 1 meta-analysis of large cohort studies, 1 systematic review and narrative synthesis, 1 genetic association study and 1 umbrella review. Quality of reviews was variable with some genetic studies of high quality. Two meta-analyses of overlapping studies examining the serotonin metabolite, 5-HIAA, showed no association with depression (largest               n               \,=\,1002). One meta-analysis of cohort studies of plasma serotonin showed no relationship with depression, and evidence that lowered serotonin concentration was associated with antidepressant use (               n               \,=\,1869). Two meta-analyses of overlapping studies examining the 5-HT               1A               receptor (largest               n               \,=\,561), and three meta-analyses of overlapping studies examining SERT binding (largest               n               \,=\,1845) showed weak and inconsistent evidence of reduced binding in some areas, which would be consistent with increased synaptic availability of serotonin in people with depression, if this was the original, causal abnormaly. However,~effects of prior antidepressant use were not reliably excluded. One meta-analysis of tryptophan depletion studies found no effect in most healthy volunteers (               n               \,=\,566), but weak evidence of an effect in those with a family history of depression (               n               \,=\,75). Another systematic review (               n               \,=\,342) and a sample of ten subsequent studies (               n               \,=\,407) found no effect in volunteers. No systematic review of tryptophan depletion studies has been performed since 2007. The two largest and highest quality studies of the SERT gene, one genetic association study (               n               \,=\,115,257) and one collaborative meta-analysis (               n               \,=\,43,165), revealed no evidence of an association with depression, or of an interaction between genotype, stress and depression. The main areas of serotonin research provide no consistent evidence of there being an association between serotonin and depression, and no support for the hypothesis that depression is caused by lowered serotonin activity or concentrations. Some evidence was consistent with the possibility that long-term antidepressant use reduces serotonin concentration.},

  abstract = {Background: Fungi constitute an important yet frequently neglected component of the human microbiota with a possible role in health and disease. Fungi and bacteria colonise the infant gastrointestinal tract in parallel, yet most infant microbiome studies have ignored fungi. Milk is a source of diverse and viable bacteria, but few studies have assessed the diversity of fungi in human milk. Results: Here we profiled mycobiota in milk from 271 mothers in the CHILD birth cohort and detected fungi in 58 (21.4\%). Samples containing detectable fungi were dominated by Candida, Alternaria, and Rhodotorula, and had lower concentrations of two human milk oligosaccharides (disialyllacto-N-tetraose and lacto-N-hexaose). The presence of milk fungi was associated with multiple outdoor environmental features (city, population density, and season), maternal atopy, and early-life antibiotic exposure. In addition, despite a strong positive correlation between bacterial and fungal richness, there was a co-exclusion pattern between the most abundant fungus (Candida) and most of the core bacterial genera. Conclusion: We profiled human milk mycobiota in a well-characterised cohort of mother-infant dyads and provide evidence of possible host-environment interactions in fungal inoculation. Further research is required to establish the role of breastfeeding in delivering fungi to the developing infant, and to assess the health impact of the milk microbiota in its entirety, including both bacterial and fungal components.},

Network analysis offers a useful tool in this pursuit with the ability to identify associations between immune markers and individual symptoms, independent of all other variables modeled. However, investigation into how methodological decisions (i.e., including vs. excluding participants with C-reactive protein (CRP) {$>$}10~mg/L, regularized vs. nonregularized networks) influence results is necessary to establish best practices for the use of network analysis in immunopsychiatry. In a sample of 3,464 adult participants from the 2015\textendash 2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey dataset, this study found consistent support for associations between CRP and fatigue and changes in appetite and some support for additional CRP\textemdash criterion associations. Methodologically, results consistently demonstrated that including individuals with CRP {$>$}10~mg/L and estimating nonregularized networks provided better estimates of these associations. Thus, we recommend considering the use of nonregularized networks in immunopsychiatry and inclusion of cases with CRP values {$>$}10~mg/L when testing the association between CRP and depression criteria, unless contraindicated by the research question being tested. Additionally, results most consistently suggest that CRP is uniquely related to fatigue and changes in appetite, supporting their inclusion in an immunometabolic phenotype of depression. Finally, these associations suggest that fatigue and changes in appetite might be particularly receptive to anti-inflammatory treatments. However, future research with more nuanced measures is necessary to parse out whether appetite increases or decreases drive this association. Further, longitudinal research is an important next step to test how these relationships manifest over time.},

This review analyzes the available human and animal literature regarding maternal use of marijuana during lactation. The findings can be categorized into four areas of analysis: effects of marijuana on the mother, transfer into milk, transfer to the offspring, and effects on the offspring. Human and animal data have reported decreased prolactin levels as well as potential maternal psychological changes. Animal and human studies have reported transfer into milk; levels were detected in animal offspring, and metabolites were excreted by both human and animal offspring. Further, animal data have predominately displayed motor, neurobehavioral, and developmental effects, whereas human data suggested possible psychomotor outcomes; however, some studies reported no effect. Despite these results, many human studies were marred by limitations, including small sample sizes and confounding variables. Also, the applicability of animal data to the human population is questionable and the true risk of adverse effects is not entirely known. There are large gaps in the literature that need to be addressed; in particular, studies need to focus on evaluating the short- and long-term consequences of maternal marijuana use for the infant and the potential for different risks based on the frequency of maternal use. Until further evidence becomes available, practitioners need to weigh the benefits of breastfeeding for mother and child, with the potential influence of marijuana on infant development when determining the infant's most suitable form of nutrition.},

  abstract = {Background. Parental absences in childhood are often associated with accelerated reproductive maturity in humans. These results are counterintuitive for evolutionary social scientists because reductions in parental investment should be detrimental for offspring, but earlier reproduction is generally associated with higher fitness. In this paper we discuss a neglected hypothesis that early reproduction is often associated with parental absence because it decreases the average relatedness of a developing child to her future siblings. Family members often help each other reproduce, meaning that parents and offspring may find themselves in competition over reproductive opportunities. In these intergenerational negotiations offspring will have less incentive to help the remaining parent rear future half-siblings relative to beginning reproduction themselves.Method. We illustrate this ``intergenerational conflict hypothesis'' with a formal game-theoretic model.Results. We show that when resources constrain reproductive opportunities within the family, parents will generally win reproductive conflicts with their offspring, i.e., they will produce more children of their own and therefore delay existing offsprings' reproduction. This is due to the asymmetric relatedness between grandparents and grandchildren (r = .25), compared to siblings (r = 0.5), resulting in greater incentives for older siblings to help rear younger siblings than for grandparents to help rear grandchildren. However, if a parent loses or replaces their partner, the conflict between the parent and offspring becomes symmetric since half siblings are as related to one another as grandparents are to grandchildren. This means that the offspring stand to gain more from earlier reproduction when their remaining parent would produce half, rather than full, siblings. We further show that if parents senesce in a way that decreases the quality of their infant relative to their offspring's infant, the intergenerational conflict can shift to favor the younger generation.},

This is partly justified by the phenomena's cooccurrence in correlational studies. Here we argue that these behaviors are better modeled as functionally independent adaptations that arose in response to different selection pressures throughout human evolution. As such, different mechanisms may be triggered by different group boundaries within a single society. We illustrate this functionalist framework using ethnographic work from the Quechua-Aymara language boundary in the Peruvian Altiplano. We show that different group boundaries motivate different ethnic phenomena. For example, people have strong stereotypes about socioeconomic categories, which are not cooperative units, whereas they hold fewer stereotypes about communities, which are the primary focus of cooperative activity. We also show that, despite the cross-cultural importance of ethnolinguistic boundaries, the Quechua-Aymara linguistic distinction does not strongly motivate any of these intergroup processes.},

However, gaps remain in our understanding of how primate males regulate and allocate energetic resources between survivorship and reproductive effort. Defense against parasitic infection is an important force shaping life history evolution. Proper performance of immunological responses against infection is influenced by many physiological systems, including metabolic, reproductive, and stress hormones. Because androgens influence and modulate immune, reproductive, and somatic metabolic functions, assessing changes in testosterone and immune factors during infection may yield insight into male physiological ecology. In this review, we examine male life history trade-offs between immune and reproductive endocrine functions as well as provide a comprehensive review of testosterone\textendash immunocompetence relationships. Emphasis is placed on testosterone because it is a primary hormone shown to be crucial to energy-allocation processes in vertebrates. Non-primate species have been used more extensively in this research than humans or non-human primates, and therefore this extensive literature is organized and reviewed in order to better understand potential parallel relationships in primates, especially humans. Furthermore, we attempt to reconcile the many inconsistent results obtained from field studies on immune\textendash endocrine interactions as well as detail various methodologies that may be used to forward this research in evolutionary anthropology.

These trends have been identified as a public health crisis in urgent need of new solutions and have spurred significant research efforts to improve our understanding of suicide and strategies to prevent it. Unfortunately, despite making significant contributions to the founding of suicidology \textendash{} through Emile Durkheim's classic Suicide (1897 [1951]) \textendash{} sociology's role has been less prominent in contemporary efforts to address these tragic trends, though as we will show, sociological theories offer great promise for advancing our understanding of suicide and improving the efficacy of suicide prevention. Here, we review sociological theory and empirical research on suicide. We begin where all sociologists must: with Durkheim. However, we offer a more comprehensive understanding of Durkheim's insights into suicide than the prior reviews provided by those in other disciplines. In so doing, we reveal the nuance and richness of Durkheim's insights that have been largely lost in modern suicidology, despite being foundational to all sociological theories of suicide \textendash{} even those that have moved beyond his model. We proceed to discuss broadly acknowledged limitations to Durkheim's theory of suicide and review how more recent theoretical efforts have not only addressed those concerns, but have done so by bringing a larger swatch of sociology's theoretical and empirical toolkit to bare on suicide. Specifically, we review how recent sociological theories of suicide have incorporated insights from social network theories, cultural sociology, sociology of emotions, and sociological social psychology to better theorize how the external social world matters to individual psychological pain and suffering. We conclude by making explicit bridges between sociological and psychological theories of suicide; by noting important limitations in knowledge about suicide \textendash{} particularly regarding the roles of organizations, inequality, and intersectionality in suicide \textendash{} that sociology is well situated to help address.},

  abstract = {Demographic data from wild chimpanzees are of considerable interest for understanding the evolution of the human life history. Published mortality data, however, come primarily from chimpanzee populations that have recently suffered dramatic, human-induced declines, and exhibit rates of reproduction well below replacement. Here we present a life table for chimpanzees living in the Kanyawara community of Kibale National Park, comprising 1129 individual risk years and 56 deaths. This community has shown modest growth over the past 25 years, avoiding some of the worst impacts of human contact. Sex differences in mortality at Kanyawara appeared similar to those reported from other sites. However, overall mortality rates were significantly lower than those reported from the long-term study sites of Gombe, Ta\"i and Mahale. Kanyawara chimpanzees in this sample had a life expectancy at birth of 19 years, and individuals living to age 14 could expect to live for another 24 years. Life table data from Kanyawara indicate a mean mortality rate of 3.9\% per year over the ages of 10\textendash 35, substantially less than the equivalent figure of 6.8\% from a sample of other long-term chimpanzee study sites. The comparable adult mortality rate from a range of human foraging societies is {$\sim$}2\%. The Kanyawara data thus suggest an important downward revision in adult mortality rates for wild chimpanzees, but they do not challenge the existence of an important difference in adult mortality between humans and chimpanzees.},

  abstract = {Across vertebrates, species with intense male mating competition and high levels of sexual dimorphism in body size generally exhibit dimorphism in age-specific fertility. Compared with females, males show later ages at first reproduction and earlier reproductive senescence because they take longer to attain adult body size and musculature, and maintain peak condition for a limited time. This normally yields a shorter male duration of effective breeding, but this reduction might be attenuated in species that frequently use coalitionary aggression. Here, we present comparative genetic and demographic data on chimpanzees from three long-term study communities (Kanyawara: Kibale National Park, Uganda; Mitumba and Kasekela: Gombe National Park, Tanzania), comprising 581 male risk years and 112 infants, to characterize male age-specific fertility. For comparison, we update estimates from female chimpanzees in the same sites and append a sample of human foragers (the Tanzanian Hadza). Consistent with the idea that aggressive mating competition favors youth, chimpanzee males attained a higher maximum fertility than females, followed by a steeper decline with age. Males did not show a delay in reproduction compared with females, however, as adolescents in both sites successfully reproduced by targeting young, subfecund females, who were less attractive to adults. Gombe males showed earlier reproductive senescence and a shorter duration of effective breeding than Gombe females. By contrast, older males in Kanyawara generally continued to reproduce, apparently by forming coalitions with the alpha. Hadza foragers showed a distinct pattern of sexual dimorphism in age-specific fertility as, compared with women, men gained conceptions later but continued reproducing longer. In sum, both humans and chimpanzees showed sexual dimorphism in age-specific fertility that deviated from predictions drawn from primates with more extreme body size dimorphism, suggesting altered dynamics of male-male competition in the two lineages. In both species, coalitions appear important for extending male reproductive careers.},

  abstract = {Research suggests that spaced learning, compared with massed learning, results in superior long-term retention (the spacing effect). Son (2010) identified a potentially important moderator of the spacing effect: metacognitive control. Specifically, when participants chose massed restudy but were instead forced to space the restudy, the spacing effect disappeared in adults (or was reduced in children). This suggests spacing is less effective (or possibly ineffective) if implemented against the wishes of the learner. A closer examination of this paradigm, however, reveals that item-selection issues might alternatively explain the disappearance of the spacing effect. In the current experiments, we replicated the original design demonstrating that an itemselection confound is operating. Furthermore, relative to a more appropriate baseline, the spacing effect was significant and of the same size whether participants' restudy choices were honored or violated. In this paradigm, metacognitive control does not appear to moderate the spacing effect.},

Epigenetic modifications influence gene expression, which can lead to changes in an individual's phenotype. DNA methylation is an important epigenetic modification that varies throughout the lifespan and appears to respond to a wide range of psychosocial and biological stressors. The effects of early-life adversity impact future health and may be passed on to future generations. The underlying model proposes that stress influences health via an epigenetic mechanism involving altered DNA methylation and gene expression. This review summarizes a range of studies that have identified DNA methylation at specific genes and throughout the genome in association with multiple psychosocial stressors, including psychiatric disorders, sexual and physical abuse, and war trauma. Future studies should test a comprehensive list of epigenetic modifications in association with psychosocial stressors and multiple health outcomes.},

  abstract = {Evidence on the relative importance of geographical distribution and associated factors with intimate partner violence (IPV) can inform regional and national health programs on women's health. Four thousand seven hundred and twenty married women aged 15-49 years were interviewed in 2016 about IPV and this data was extracted from the Ethiopian Demographic Health Survey (EDHS) in 2020. The sample was selected by a two-staged cluster survey of women. The analysis was conducted using logistic regression that adjusted for clustering and sampling weights. Moreover, weighted proportions of IPV were exported to ArcGIS to conduct autocorrelations to assess the clustering of IPV. Amongst the 4469 married women who were 15 to 49 years of age included in the analysis, 34\% (95\% CI, 31.4\%-36.3\%) experienced IPV, 23.5\% ( 95\% CI, 21.5\%-25.7\%) experienced physical violence, 10.1\% (95\% CI, 8.7\%- 11.7 \%) experienced sexual violence and 24\% (95\% CI, 21.7\%-26.4 \%) experienced emotional violence. Partners' controlling behaviour [AOR: 3.94; 95\% CI, 3.03- 5.12], partner's alcohol consumption [AOR: 2.59; 95\% CI, 1.80- 3.71], partner educational qualifications [AOR: 2.16; 95\% CI, 1.26- 3.71], a woman birthing more than five children [AOR: 1.70; 95\% CI, 1.12- 2.56] and a history of the woman's father being physically violent towards her mother [AOR: 1.99; 95\% CI, 1.52- 2.59] were associated with an increased risk of IPV amongst married women in Ethiopia. Western and Central Oromia, Western Amhara, Gambella and Central Tigray and Hararri were identified as hot spot areas in Ethiopia (p{$<$}0.001). In this study, there was a significant geographic clustering of IPV in Ethiopia. Controlling and drinking behaviour and partners' unemployment status were identified as important factors for married women experiencing IPV. Hence, there is a need for a context- driven evidence-based design intervention to reduce the impact of IPV.},

A similar sex-related difference in haemoglobin levels in adult animals is found in many species of mammals, birds and reptiles, indicating that it is an important physiological phenomenon. It is probably a direct effect of sex hormones, both oestrogen and androgens, on erythropoiesis. However, since there is no difference in erythropoietin levels between the sexes, this effect most likely takes place in the kidney, rather than in the bone marrow. Oestrogens dilate and androgens constrict the renal microvasculature: dilation and vasoconstriction in vessels below 300{$\mu$}m in diameter respectively increase and decrease the haematocrit in blood in arterioles, capillaries and venules, altering the oxygen delivery per unit red cell mass, and providing a mechanism for varying the red cell mass without compensatory changes in erythropoiesis.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES To measure the burden of diseases, injuries, and leading risk factors in the United States from 1990 to 2010 and to compare these measurements with those of the 34 countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. DESIGN We used the systematic analysis of descriptive epidemiology of 291 diseases and injuries, 1160 sequelae of these diseases and injuries, and 67 risk factors or clusters of risk factors from 1990 to 2010 for 187 countries developed for the Global Burden of Disease 2010 Study to describe the health status of the United States and to compare US health outcomes with those of 34 OECD countries. Years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLLs) were computed by multiplying the number of deaths at each age by a reference life expectancy at that age. Years lived with disability (YLDs) were calculated by multiplying prevalence (based on systematic reviews) by the disability weight (based on population-based surveys) for each sequela; disability in this study refers to any short- or long-term loss of health. Disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were estimated as the sum of YLDs and YLLs. Deaths and DALYs related to risk factors were based on systematic reviews and meta-analyses of exposure data and relative risks for risk-outcome pairs. Healthy life expectancy (HALE) was used to summarize overall population health, accounting for both length of life and levels of ill health experienced at different ages. RESULTS US life expectancy for both sexes combined increased from 75.2 years in 1990 to 78.2 years in 2010; during the same period, HALE increased from 65.8 years to 68.1 years. The diseases and injuries with the largest number of YLLs in 2010 were ischemic heart disease, lung cancer, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and road injury. Age-standardized YLL rates increased for Alzheimer disease, drug use disorders, chronic kidney disease, kidney cancer, and falls. The diseases with the largest number of YLDs in 2010 were low back pain, major depressive disorder, other musculoskeletal disorders, neck pain, and anxiety disorders. As the US population has aged, YLDs have comprised a larger share of DALYs than have YLLs. The leading risk factors related to DALYs were dietary risks, tobacco smoking, high body mass index, high blood pressure, high fasting plasma glucose, physical inactivity, and alcohol use. Among 34 OECD countries between 1990 and 2010, the US rank for the age-standardized death rate changed from 18th to 27th, for the age-standardized YLL rate from 23rd to 28th, for the age-standardized YLD rate from 5th to 6th, for life expectancy at birth from 20th to 27th, and for HALE from 14th to 26th. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE From 1990 to 2010, the United States made substantial progress in improving health. Life expectancy at birth and HALE increased, all-cause death rates at all ages decreased, and age-specific rates of years lived with disability remained stable. However, morbidity and chronic disability now account for nearly half of the US health burden, and improvements in population health in the United States have not kept pace with advances in population health in other wealthy nations.},

  abstract = {Background The Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 (GBD 2013) aims to bring together all available epidemiological data using a coherent measurement framework, standardised estimation methods, and transparent data sources to enable comparisons of health loss over time and across causes, age\textendash sex groups, and countries. The GBD can be used to generate summary measures such as disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and healthy life expectancy (HALE) that make possible comparative assessments of broad epidemiological patterns across countries and time. These summary measures can also be used to quantify the component of variation in epidemiology that is related to sociodemographic development. Methods We used the published GBD 2013 data for age-specific mortality, years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLLs), and years lived with disability (YLDs) to calculate DALYs and HALE for 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2013 for 188 countries. We calculated HALE using the Sullivan method; 95\% uncertainty intervals (UIs) represent uncertainty in age-specific death rates and YLDs per person for each country, age, sex, and year. We estimated DALYs for 306 causes for each country as the sum of YLLs and YLDs; 95\% UIs represent uncertainty in YLL and YLD rates. We quantified patterns of the epidemiological transition with a composite indicator of sociodemographic status, which we constructed from income per person, average years of schooling after age 15 years, and the total fertility rate and mean age of the population. We applied hierarchical regression to DALY rates by cause across countries to decompose variance related to the sociodemographic status variable, country, and time. Findings Worldwide, from 1990 to 2013, life expectancy at birth rose by 6{$\cdot$}2 years (95\% UI 5{$\cdot$}6\textendash 6{$\cdot$}6), from 65{$\cdot$}3 years (65{$\cdot$}0\textendash 65{$\cdot$}6) in 1990 to 71{$\cdot$}5 years (71{$\cdot$}0\textendash 71{$\cdot$}9) in 2013, HALE at birth rose by 5{$\cdot$}4 years (4{$\cdot$}9\textendash 5{$\cdot$}8), from 56{$\cdot$}9 years (54{$\cdot$}5\textendash 59{$\cdot$}1) to 62{$\cdot$}3 years (59{$\cdot$}7\textendash 64{$\cdot$}8), total DALYs fell by 3{$\cdot$}6\% (0{$\cdot$}3\textendash 7{$\cdot$}4), and age-standardised DALY rates per 100\hphantom{,}000 people fell by 26{$\cdot$}7\% (24{$\cdot$}6\textendash 29{$\cdot$}1). For communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional disorders, global DALY numbers, crude rates, and age-standardised rates have all declined between 1990 and 2013, whereas for non\textendash communicable diseases, global DALYs have been increasing, DALY rates have remained nearly constant, and age-standardised DALY rates declined during the same period. From 2005 to 2013, the number of DALYs increased for most specific non-communicable diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and neoplasms, in addition to dengue, food-borne trematodes, and leishmaniasis; DALYs decreased for nearly all other causes. By 2013, the five leading causes of DALYs were ischaemic heart disease, lower respiratory infections, cerebrovascular disease, low back and neck pain, and road injuries. Sociodemographic status explained more than 50\% of the variance between countries and over time for diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and other common infectious diseases; maternal disorders; neonatal disorders; nutritional deficiencies; other communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases; musculoskeletal disorders; and other non-communicable diseases. However, sociodemographic status explained less than 10\% of the variance in DALY rates for cardiovascular diseases; chronic respiratory diseases; cirrhosis; diabetes, urogenital, blood, and endocrine diseases; unintentional injuries; and self-harm and interpersonal violence. Predictably, increased sociodemographic status was associated with a shift in burden from YLLs to YLDs, driven by declines in YLLs and increases in YLDs from musculoskeletal disorders, neurological disorders, and mental and substance use disorders. In most country-specific estimates, the increase in life expectancy was greater than that in HALE. Leading causes of DALYs are highly variable across countries. Interpretation Global health is improving. Population growth and ageing have driven up numbers of DALYs, but crude rates have remained relatively constant, showing that progress in health does not mean fewer demands on health systems. The notion of an epidemiological transition\textemdash in which increasing sociodemographic status brings structured change in disease burden\textemdash is useful, but there is tremendous variation in burden of disease that is not associated with sociodemographic status. This further underscores the need for country-specific assessments of DALYs and HALE to appropriately inform health policy decisions and attendant actions. Funding Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation.},

  abstract = {Background and objectives: Postnatal depression (PND) presents a puzzling phenomenon to evolutionary anthropologists as it is highly prevalent and yet detrimental to child development and maternal health. Adaptive explanations have been proposed, but have not been tested with data that directly link PND to female fertility.Methodology: A survey was designed to gather complete reproductive histories and retrospective measures of PND to measure the effects of PND on fitness. Respondents were born between 1930 and 1967, with the majority based in the UK during their childrearing years. The hypothesis that PND is detrimental to fitness is assessed using Mann\textendash Whitney U tests on completed fertility. Binary logistic regression modelling is used to test the hypothesis that PND reduces the likelihood of parity progression.Results: Women experiencing PND at their first or second birth have lower completed fertility, with PND at the first birth leading to lowered fertility. Logistic regression analyses show that this is the result of reductions in the likelihood of parity progression to a third birth when PND is experienced at the first birth or when repeat bouts occur.Conclusions and implications: Our results call into question adaptationist arguments, contribute to the growing understanding of the importance of emotional wellbeing to fertility decision making, and given the economic consequences of markedly below replacement fertility, highlight a potential new source of financial incentive to invest in screening and preventative measures to ensure good maternal mental health.},

  abstract = {Rationale A growing body of literature links both depressive symptoms generally, and those specifically in the postnatal period, with an inflammatory immune response. Evolutionary medical approaches, such as the Pathogen Host Defence Theory of Depression (PATHOS-D), have likened depression to sickness behaviour in other mammals, and propose that the characteristics associated with depression are protective when an individual is experiencing pathogenic threat. Many known risk factors for depressive symptoms are associated with activation of inflammatory pathways, opening up the potential for identifying novel risk factors based on their inflammation causing effects. Objective Both the gestation of male foetuses and the experience of birth complications have documented associations with increased inflammation, yet their relationships with postnatal depression (PND) are currently unclear. Method Here we use the complete reproductive histories of 296 women from contemporary, low fertility populations gathered by retrospective survey to assess whether the odds of PND increased when mothers gave birth to male infants or experienced birth complications, using generalised estimating equation models controlling for individual effects of the mother and other known PND risk factors. Results We found the odds of PND increased by 71\textendash 79\% when male infants were born compared to female infants. The occurrence of birth complications increased the odds of PND by 174\% compared to having no complications. Testing for interaction effects found that, while always at increased risk of PND, women with a tendency towards symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress at other points in the life course had reduced odds of PND when experiencing birth complications, suggesting such women may elicit greater support. Conclusions These results highlight two novel PND risk factors, male infants and birth complications, which can be easily assessed by health professionals.},

In 2013, 134,799 people committed suicide in India according to the statistics released by the National Crime Records Bureau. Suicide note is one of the most important sources to understand suicide, which may be beneficial in suicide prevention. Studies on suicidal notes from this part of the world are sparse. Objective: The aim was to study the themes in suicide notes that might be useful in prevention strategies. Materials and Methods: A descriptive study of all suicide notes of those individuals who committed suicide between 2010 and 2013 available with Police Department, Mysore district was obtained and analyzed. Results: A total of 22 suicide note were available. A majority of suicide note was in age group of 16\textendash 40 years (86\%) and most were men (59\%). All suicide notes were handwritten, the majority (70\%) in regional language Kannada. Length of notes varied from just few words to few pages. Contents of suicide notes included apology/shame/guilt (80\%), love for those left behind (55\%) and instruction regarding practical affairs (23\%). Most have blamed none for the act (50\%). 23\% mentioned that they are committing suicide to prove their innocence. 32\% mentioned a last wish. Conclusion: The majority of suicidal note contained ``guilt'' which is a strong indicator of possible depression in deceased. Creating awareness about suicide among public and ensuring access to professionals trained in suicide prevention is need of the hour in this part of the world.},

  abstract = {Socioeconomic status (SES) is a complex and multidimensional construct, encompassing both independent objective characteristics (e.g., income or education) and subjective people's ratings of their placement in the socioeconomic spectrum. Within the growing literature on subjective SES belongingness and psychological well-being, subjective indices of SES have tended to center on the use of pictorial rank-related social ladders where individuals place themselves relative to others by simultaneously considering their income, educational level, and occupation. This approach, albeit consistent with the idea of these social ladders as summative or cognitive SES markers, might potentially constrain individuals' conceptions of their SES. This research (N = 368; Mage = 39.67, SD = 13.40) is intended to expand prior investigations on SES and psychological well-being by revisiting the role of subjective SES. In particular, it (a) proposes an innovative adaptation of the traditional MacArthur Scale of subjective SES to income, education, and occupation, thus resulting in three separate social ladders; and (b) tests the empirical contribution of such three social ladders to psychological well-being. Overall, our findings showed that the novel education and occupation ladders (excluding the income ladder) are predictive of a significant part of the variance levels of psychological well-being that is not due to canonical objective metrics of SES (i.e., income, education, and occupation), or to the conventional MacArthur Scale of subjective SES. Although preliminary, these results underscore the need to further reconsider (subjective) SES-related conceptualization and measurement strategies to gather a more comprehensive understanding of the SES-psychological well-being link.},

  abstract = {Evolutionary biology is an essential basic science for medicine, but few doctors and medical researchers are familiar with its most relevant principles. Most medical schools have geneticists who understand evolution, but few have even one evolutionary biologist to suggest other possible applications. The canyon between evolutionary biology and medicine is wide. The question is whether they offer each other enough to make bridge building worthwhile. What benefits could be expected if evolution were brought fully to bear on the problems of medicine? How would studying medical problems advance evolutionary research? Do doctors need to learn evolution, or is it valuable mainly for researchers? What practical steps will promote the application of evolutionary biology in the areas of medicine where it offers the most? To address these questions, we review current and potential applications of evolutionary biology to medicine and public health. Some evolutionary technologies, such as population genetics, serial transfer production of live vaccines, and phylogenetic analysis, have been widely applied. Other areas, such as infectious disease and aging research, illustrate the dramatic recent progress made possible by evolutionary insights. In still other areas, such as epidemiology, psychiatry, and understanding the regulation of bodily defenses, applying evolutionary principles remains an open opportunity. In addition to the utility of specific applications, an evolutionary perspective fundamentally challenges the prevalent but fundamentally incorrect metaphor of the body as a machine designed by an engineer. Bodies are vulnerable to disease \textendash{} and remarkably resilient \textendash{} precisely because they are not machines built from a plan. They are, instead, bundles of compromises shaped by natural selection in small increments to maximize reproduction, not health. Understanding the body as a product of natural selection, not design, offers new research questions and a framework for making medical education more coherent. We conclude with recommendations for actions that would better connect evolutionary biology and medicine in ways that will benefit public health. It is our hope that faculty and students will send this article to their undergraduate and medical school Deans, and that this will initiate discussions about the gap, the great opportunity, and action plans to bring the full power of evolutionary biology to bear on human health problems.},

  abstract = {A founder of the field of evolutionary medicine uses his decades of experience as a psychiatrist to provide a much-needed new framework for making sense of mental illness.  Why do I feel bad? There is real power in understanding our bad feelings. With his classic Why We Get Sick, Dr. Randolph Nesse helped to establish the field of evolutionary medicine. Now he returns with a book that transforms our understanding of mental disorders by exploring a fundamentally new question. Instead of asking why certain people suffer from mental illness, Nesse asks why natural selection has left us all with fragile minds.  Drawing on revealing stories from his own clinical practice and insights from evolutionary biology, Nesse shows how negative emotions are useful in certain situations, yet can become overwhelming. Anxiety protects us from harm in the face of danger, but false alarms are inevitable. Low moods prevent us from wasting effort in pursuit of unreachable goals, but they often escalate into pathological depression. Other mental disorders, such as addiction and anorexia, result from the mismatch between modern environment and our ancient human past. And there are good evolutionary reasons for sexual disorders and for why genes for schizophrenia persist. Taken together, these and many more insights help to explain the pervasiveness of human suffering, and show us new paths for relieving it by understanding individuals as individuals.},

This appears to be due to their greater ability to attract mates. To our knowledge, no comparable results have yet been reported for women. This study used data from Britain's National Child Development Study to examine the life histories of a nationally representative group of women. Height was weakly but significantly related to reproductive success. The relationship was U\textendash shaped, with deficits at the extremes of height. This pattern was largely due to poor health among extremely tall and extremely short women. However, the maximum reproductive success was found below the mean height for women. Thus, selection appears to be sexually disruptive in this population, favouring tall men and short women. Over evolutionary time, such a situation tends to maintain sexual dimorphism. Men do not use stature as a positive mate\textendash choice criterion as women do. It is argued that there is good evolutionary reason for this, because men are orientated towards cues of fertility, and female height, being positively related to age of sexual maturity, is not such a cue.},

While this is plausible, it would be possible to make the opposite prediction equally plausibly: individuals in bad circumstances should take greater risks in order to improve their situations. Here, I present a simple analytical model adapted from the risk-sensitive foraging literature. It shows that in dire states, individuals should be risk-prone, in poor states, risk-averse, and in good states, risk-prone again. I discuss how the various kinds of mood state observed in humans might be understood as mechanisms for adaptively adjusting behavioural risk-taking to the current situation.},

Although HBE is a thriving research area, there has not been a major review published in a journal for over a decade, and much has changed in that time. Here, we describe the main features of HBE as a paradigm and review HBE research published since the millennium. We find that the volume of HBE research is growing rapidly, and its composition is changing in terms of topics, study populations, methodology, and disciplinary affiliations of authors. We identify the major strengths of HBE research as its vitality, clear predictions, empirical fruitfulness, broad scope, conceptual coherence, ecological validity, increasing methodological rigor, and topical innovation. Its weaknesses include a relative isolation from the rest of behavioral ecology and evolutionary biology and a somewhat limited current topic base. As HBE continues to grow, there is a major opportunity for it to serve as a bridge between the natural and social sciences and help unify disparate disciplinary approaches to human behavior. HBE also faces a number of open questions, such as how understanding of proximate mechanisms is to be integrated with behavioral ecology's traditional focus on optimal behavioral strategies, and the causes and extent of maladaptive behavior in humans.},

  abstract = {The term `life-history theory' (LHT) is increasingly often invoked in psychology, as a framework for integrating understanding of psychological traits into a broader evolutionary context. Although LHT as presented in psychology papers (LHT-P) is typically described as a straightforward extension of the theoretical principles from evolutionary biology that bear the same name (LHT-E), the two bodies of work are not well integrated. Here, through a close reading of recent papers, we argue that LHT-E and LHT-P are different research programmes in the Lakatosian sense. The core of LHT-E is built around ultimate evolutionary explanation, via explicit mathematical modelling, of how selection can drive divergent evolution of populations or species living under different demographies or ecologies. The core of LHT-P concerns measurement of covariation, across individuals, of multiple psychological traits; the proximate goals these serve; and their relation to childhood experience. Some of the links between LHT-E and LHT-P are false friends. For example, elements that are marginal in LHT-E are core commitments of LHT-P, and where explanatory principles are transferred from one to the other, nuance can be lost in transmission. The methodological rules for what grounds a prediction in theory are different in the two cases. Though there are major differences between LHT-E and LHT-P at present, there is much potential for greater integration in the future, through both theoretical modelling and further empirical research.This article is part of the theme issue `Life history and learning: how childhood, caregiving and old age shape cognition and culture in humans and other animals'.},

Meditation has also become widely used in psychological and medical practices for stress management as well as a variety of physical and mental disorders. However, until now, there has been limited understanding of the overall biological mechanism of these practices in terms of the effects in both the brain and body. We have previously described a rudimentary neuropsychological model to explain the brain mechanisms underlying meditative experiences. This paper provides a substantial development by integrating neurotransmitter systems and the results of recent brain imaging advances into the model. The following is a review and synthesis of the current literature regarding the various neurophysiological mechanisms and neurochemical substrates that underlie the complex processes of meditation. It is hoped that this model will provide hypotheses for future biological and clinical studies of meditation. \textordfeminine{} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Using multilevel modeling, we found that the extent to which people reappraised positive and negative emotions and suppressed negative emotions was positively related to the number/importance of daily positive events, whereas the suppression of positive emotions was negatively related. Furthermore, the positive relationships between well-being and reappraisal of positive and negative emotions and the suppression of negative emotions were stronger as the number of negative events increased. These results demonstrate that most emotion regulation strategies are employed when the day is going well but are most beneficial for people's well-being when the day is not going well.},

The goal of this study was to directly compare anger, anxiety, depression, and negative affect and examine whether the nomological network of these four emotional variables converges or diverges. We offer theoretical arguments for both the convergence and divergence hypotheses and use meta-analytical data based on 491 studies (N\,=\,235,085) to examine which hypothesis receives stronger support. The results show that (a) anger, anxiety, depression, and negative affect were strongly correlated with one another, (b) the corrected correlations of these variables with workplace stressors and outcomes were similar (although some differences also existed), and (c) these variables, in the presence of one another, did not explain unique variance in some study correlates. These results appear to more strongly support the convergence hypothesis, and call for more work on how negative emotions should be integrated into vocational behavior research.},

These immune changes occur in several compartments of the immune system and body (e.g. the skin, upper respiratory tract mucosal tissue, lung, blood and muscle). Although still open to interpretation, most exercise immunologists believe that during this `open window' of impaired immunity (which may last between 3 and 72 h, depending on the immune measure) viruses and bacteria may gain a foothold, increasing the risk of subclinical and clinical infection. The infection risk may be amplified when other factors related to immune function are present, including exposure to novel pathogens during travel, lack of sleep, severe mental stress, malnutrition or weight loss.},

People who engage in ruminative responses to depression, focusing on their symptoms and the possible causes and consequences of their symptoms, will show longer depression than people who take action to distract themselves from their symptoms. Ruminative responses prolong depression because they allow the depressed mood to negatively bias thinking and interfere with instrumental behavior and problem-solving. Laboratory and field studies directly testing this theory have supported its predictions. The author discusses how response styles can explain the greater likelihood of depression in women than men, then integrates this response styles theory with studies of coping with discrete events. The response style theory is compared to other theories of the duration of depression. Finally, suggestions are made that may help a depressed person to stop engaging in ruminative responses and on how response style for depression may develop.

  abstract = {Costly signaling has been proposed as a possible mechanism to explain food sharing in foraging populations. This sharing-as-signaling hypothesis predicts an association between sharing and status. Using exponential random graph modeling, this prediction is tested on a social network of between-household food-sharing relationships in the fishing and sea-hunting village of Lamalera, Indonesia. Previous analyses (Nolin, 2010. Food-sharing networks in Lamalera, Indonesia: reciprocity, kinship, and distance. Human Nature 21, 243\textendash 268) have shown that most sharing in Lamalera is consistent with reciprocal altruism. The question addressed here is whether any additional variation may be explained as sharing-as-signaling by high-status households. The results show that high-status households both give and receive more than other households, a pattern more consistent with reciprocal altruism than costly signaling. However, once the propensity to reciprocate and household productivity are controlled, households of men holding leadership positions show greater odds of unreciprocated giving when compared to households of nonleaders. This pattern of excessive giving by leaders is consistent with the sharing-as-signaling hypothesis. Wealthy households show the opposite pattern, giving less and receiving more than other households. These households may reciprocate in a currency other than food, or their wealth may attract favor-seeking behavior from others. Overall, status covariates explain little variation in the sharing network as a whole, and much of the sharing observed by high-status households is best explained by the same factors that explain sharing by other households. This pattern suggests that multiple mechanisms may operate simultaneously to promote sharing in Lamalera and that signaling may motivate some sharing by some individuals even within sharing regimes primarily maintained by other mechanisms.},

In patients, impaired grip strength is an indicator of increased postoperative complications, increased length of hospitalization, higher rehospitalisation rate and decreased physical status. In elderly in particular, loss of grip strength implies loss of independence. Epidemiological studies have moreover demonstrated that low grip strength in healthy adults predicts increased risk of functional limitations and disability in higher age as well as all-cause mortality. As muscle function reacts early to nutritional deprivation, hand grip strength has also become a popular marker of nutritional status and is increasingly being employed as outcome variable in nutritional intervention studies.},

  abstract = {Social categories both create and reflect inequality. Macro, overarching forces, and individual, perceiver biases each contribute. First, we review perspectives deriving from classic sociological and prevailing psychological social psychology, including both interpersonal fluidity and cognitive economy. Social psychologists have implicated several specific categories in social inequality. We then discuss the two that have garnered the most focus (race and gender), and next the less-studied ones (age disability, sexuality, social class, and weight). Afterward, we focus on a theory that ties together all these categories, the stereotype content model. Other structural, group-based hierarchy perspectives compliment these perspectives. Broader perspectives from social cognition highlight how categories are often automatic, at times ambiguous and ambivalent, often complex, and ultimately driven by stereotype content and sociostructural forces. Clearly much remains for social psychologists interested in hierarchy.},

Haldane posed a question to anthropologists: ``Are the biological differences between human groups comparable with those between groups of domestic animals such as greyhounds and bulldogs\ldots?'' It reads as if it were posted on social media today. The analogy comparing human races to dog breeds is not only widespread in history and pop culture, but also sounds like scientific justification for eschewing the social construction of race, or for holding racist beliefs about human nature. Here we answer Haldane's question in an effort to improve the public understanding of human biological variation and ``race''\textemdash two phenomena that are not synonymous. Speaking to everyone without expert levels of familiarity with this material, we investigate whether the dog breed analogy for human race stands up to biology. It does not. Groups of humans that are culturally labeled as ``races'' differ in population structure, genotype\textendash phenotype relationships, and phenotypic diversity from breeds of dogs in unsurprising ways, given how artificial selection has shaped the evolution of dogs, not humans. Our demonstration complements the vast body of existing knowledge about how human ``races'' differ in fundamental sociocultural, historical, and political ways from categories of nonhuman animals. By the end of this paper, readers will understand how the assumption that human races are the same as dog breeds is a racist strategy for justifying social, political, and economic inequality.},

While some studies showed that sexually dimorphic traits are related to various aspects of biological condition such as general health, immunity or fertility, still little is known about the relationship between masculine traits and the effectiveness of innate and adaptive immunity in humans. The aim of this study was to see if masculine traits, which are dependent on androgen levels in foetal and pubertal stages of development, are related to the immune quality in healthy men. The immune quality was evaluated for 91 healthy men aged 19\textendash 36 years. Immunity measurements included innate and adaptive parameters. General health status, age, testosterone level, BMI, physical activity, and smoking were controlled. The shoulder-to-hip ratio (SHR), 2D:4D digit ratio and hand-grip strength (HGS) were used as markers of masculinization. The regressions showed that when controlling for confounds, masculinity-related traits were in general not related to innate and adaptive immunity. Only a weak association was observed for right 2D:4D ratio and T-lymphocyte counts (but it becomes non-significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons). Our results do not support the premise that masculinity is a cue for immunological quality in men. However, the positive association between right 2D:4D and T lymphocytes might suggest that further studies are needed to verify if androgen stimulation in prenatal development might be related to immunity in adulthood.},

According to ICHH only high-quality individuals can maintain high levels of testosterone and afford the physiological cost of hormone-derived immunosuppression. The animal and human studies that attempted to support the ICHH by precisely defined impairment of immunity associated with high testosterone levels are inconclusive. Furthermore, human studies have used only selected immune functions and varying testosterone fractions. This is the first study examining the relationship between multiple innate and adaptive immunity and serum levels of free testosterone, total testosterone, DHT and DHEA in ninety-seven healthy men. Free testosterone and marginally DHT levels were positively correlated with the strength of the influenza post-vaccination response. Total testosterone and DHEA showed no immunomodulatory properties. Our findings did not support ICHH assumptions about immunosuppressive function of androgens. In the affluent society studied here, men with higher levels of free testosterone could afford to invest more in adaptive immunity. Since the hormone-immune relationship is complex and may depend on multiple factors, including access to food resources, androgens should be treated as immunomodulators rather than implicit immunosuppressants.},

J Strength Cond Res 37(2): 494\textendash 536, 2023\textemdash Biological sex and its relation with exercise participation and sports performance continue to be discussed. Here, the purpose was to inform such discussions by summarizing the literature on sex differences in numerous strength training\textendash related variables and outcomes\textemdash muscle strength and endurance, muscle mass and size, muscle fiber type, muscle twitch forces, and voluntary activation; strength training participation rates, motivations, preferences, and practices; and injuries and changes in muscle size and strength with strength training. Male subjects become notably stronger than female subjects around age 15 years. In adults, sex differences in strength are more pronounced in upper-body than lower-body muscles and in concentric than eccentric contractions. Greater male than female strength is not because of higher voluntary activation but to greater muscle mass and type II fiber areas. Men participate in strength training more frequently than women. Men are motivated more by challenge, competition, social recognition, and a desire to increase muscle size and strength. Men also have greater preference for competitive, high-intensity, and upper-body exercise. Women are motivated more by improved attractiveness, muscle ``toning,'' and body mass management. Women have greater preference for supervised and lower-body exercise. Intrasexual competition, mate selection, and the drive for muscularity are likely fundamental causes of exercise behaviors in men and women. Men and women increase muscle size and strength after weeks of strength training, but women experience greater relative strength improvements depending on age and muscle group. Men exhibit higher strength training injury rates. No sex difference exists in strength loss and muscle soreness after muscle-damaging exercise.},

Their heightened vulnerability to environmental stressors makes it important to obtain appropriate urine samples for exposure characterization. However, collecting urine from non-toilet-trained children has been shown to be methodologically and practically challenging. Four urine collection approaches were tested: a disposable diaper, a urine bag, a collection pad and the clean catch. The success rate and the user rating of each method was evaluated. The success rates were 67\%, 21\%, 17\% and 4\% for the disposable diaper, urine bag, collection pad and clean catch, respectively. The average user ratings on a 0\textendash 10 (0 = inconvenient, 10 = convenient) scale were 9.0, 4.7, 7.3 and 2.5, respectively. Subsequently, the best rated method, the disposable polyacrylate diaper was tested with hydroxy-tebuconazole as an exposure biomarker for the fungicide tebuconazole and creatinine for urine density adjustment. After LC\textendash MS/MS analysis, the recoveries of hydroxy-tebuconazole in the range of 0.05\textendash 25\,ng/mL were on average 106\%, and for creatinine 87\%. Precisions (relative standard deviation) were for both 3\%. The overall procedure including collection and extraction was assessed, resulting in three out of seven positive samples. Based on this study, the disposable diaper is a suitable method for urine collection of non-toilet-trained children for biomonitoring of tebuconazole. This method can serve as a basis for extension to other substances of interest.},

Risk factors mirror those typically found with major depression, with the exception of postpartum-specific factors such as sensitivity to hormone changes. Controlled trials of psychological interventions have validated a variety of individual and group interventions. Medication often leads to depression improvement, but in controlled trials there are often no significant differences in outcomes between patients in the medication condition and those in placebo or active control conditions. Reviews converge on recommendations for particular antidepressant medications for use while breastfeeding. Prevention of PPD appears to be feasible and effective. Finally, there is a growing movement to integrate mental health screening into routine primary care for pregnant and postpartum women and to follow up this screening with treatment or referral and with follow-up care.

In this paper, we argue that the distinctive features of human culture derive from humans' unique skills and motivations for coordinating with one another around different types of action and information. As different levels of these skills of `shared intentionality' emerged over the last several hundred thousand years, human culture became characterized first by such things as collaborative activities and pedagogy based on cooperative communication, and then by such things as collaborative innovations and normatively structured pedagogy. As a kind of capstone of this trajectory, humans began to coordinate not just on joint actions and shared beliefs, but on the reasons for what we believe or how we act. Coordinating on reasons powered the kinds of extremely rapid innovation and stable cumulative cultural evolution especially characteristic of the human species in the last several tens of thousands of years.

  abstract = {The idea that in behavioral research everything correlates with everything else was a niche area of the scientific literature for more than half a century. With the increasing availability of large data sets in psychology, the ``crud'' factor has, however, become more relevant than ever before. When referenced in empirical work, it is often used by researchers to discount minute\textemdash but statistically significant\textemdash effects that are deemed too small to be considered meaningful. This review tracks the history of the crud factor and examines how its use in the psychological- and behavioral-science literature has developed to this day. We highlight a common and deep-seated lack of understanding about what the crud factor is and discuss whether it can be proven to exist or estimated and how it should be interpreted. This lack of understanding makes the crud factor a convenient tool for psychologists to use to disregard unwanted results, even though the presence of a crud factor should be a large inconvenience for the discipline. To inspire a concerted effort to take the crud factor more seriously, we clarify the definitions of important concepts, highlight current pitfalls, and pose questions that need to be addressed to ultimately improve understanding of the crud factor. Such work will be necessary to develop the crud factor into a useful concept encouraging improved psychological research.},

  abstract = {Background Contrary to social constructions of new motherhood as a joyous time, mothers may experience postnatal depression and anger. Although postnatal depression has been thoroughly studied, the expression of maternal anger in the context of postnatal depression is conceptually unclear. This integrative review investigated the framing of anger in the context of postnatal depression. Methods After undertaking a search of CINAHL, Ovid-Medline, PsycInfo, and Web of Science, we identified qualitative (n = 7) and quantitative (n = 17) papers that addressed maternal anger and postnatal depression. We analyzed the data by developing themes. Results Our review indicated that anger was a salient mood disturbance for some postnatally depressed women with themes integrated as: (i) anger accompanying depression, (ii) powerlessness as a component of depression and anger, and (iii) anger occurring as a result of expectations being violated. CONCLUSIONS Our findings indicate that anger can coexist with women's postnatal depression. Anger can be expressed toward the self and toward children and family members with negative relationship effects. We recommend that health care providers and researchers consider anger in the context of postnatal mood disturbances.},

  abstract = {Substance use in pregnancy has been a prominent public health concern for the last several decades. Since the legalization of cannabis in Canada and across several American states, cannabis use during pregnancy has gained considerable public health, scientific, and media attention. This critical interpretive synthesis explores how the problem of cannabis use in pregnancy is constructed in the scientific literature and illuminates clinical, social, and political responses this construction engenders. The state of empirical evidence regarding the impact of perinatal cannabis use is fraught; a number of studies, of variable quality, have found no associations between cannabis use and adverse neonatal outcomes, while others have found cannabis to be associated with low birthweight and prematurity among other risks. Despite the inconsistent nature of the evidence base, the literature is underpinned by two important assumptions: prenatal cannabis exposure is an asocial phenomenon that can be disentangled from the social determinants of health, and cannabis exposure has detrimental effects on fetal and neonatal health. These assumptions shape indicators of signal and noise in the data by influencing the significance ascribed to particular findings, producing patterns of data interpretation that ultimately transform evidence of potential harms into certain risks and creates the mirage of a cohesive, unambiguous evidence base. We argue that the way that cannabis use in pregnancy is framed as a scientific and public health problem in the literature contributes to the stigmatization of pregnant people who use substances. We caution that failure to consider the interplay between environment, resources and other social determinants of health may ultimately cause undue harm to families and foreclose opportunities for investments that may promote health and well-being.},

  abstract = {Perinatal cannabis use is increasing, and clinician counselling is an important aspect of reducing the potential harm of cannabis use during pregnancy and lactation. To understand current counselling practices, we conducted a systematic review and integrative mixed-methods synthesis to determine ``how do perinatal clinicians respond to pregnant and lactating patients who use cannabis?''We searched 6 databases up until 2021-05-31. Eligible studies described the attitudes, perceptions, or beliefs of perinatal clinician about cannabis use during pregnancy or lactation. Eligible clinicians were those whose practice particularly focusses on pregnant and postpartum patients. The search was not limited by study design, geography, or year. We used a convergent integrative analysis method to extract relevant findings for inductive analysis.Thirteen studies were included; describing perspectives of 1,366 clinicians in 4 countries. We found no unified approach to screening and counselling. Clinicians often cited insufficient evidence around the effects of perinatal cannabis use and lacked confidence in counselling about use. At times, this meant clinicians did not address cannabis use with patients. Most counselled for cessation and there was little recognition of the varied reasons that patients might use cannabis, and an over-reliance on counselling focussed on the legal implications of use.Current approaches to responding to cannabis use might result in inadequate counselling. Counselling may be improved through increased education and training, which would facilitate conversations to mitigate the potential harm of perinatal cannabis use while recognizing the benefits patients perceive.Cannabis use during pregnancy and breastfeeding is common and understanding current physician counselling approaches is important to identify gaps and to make suggestions for practice. We conducted a systematic review of the literature to understand how physicians respond to pregnant or breastfeeding patients who use cannabis. We found 13 eligible articles in our review and our analysis showed that there was no common approach to screening and counselling patients. Physicians often described needing more training and education to support their confidence. Additionally, physicians often did not address the various medical reasons for which patients might use cannabis during pregnancy and breastfeeding. We suggest that counselling approaches may be improved through increased education and training. This could facilitate conversations to help mitigate the potential harm of cannabis use while recognizing the benefits patients perceive and thus establish strong patient\textendash physician relationships.},

  abstract = {Recent research has highlighted unequal treatment for women in academic economics along several different dimensions: promotion, hiring, credit for co-authorship, and standards for publication in professional journals. Can the source of these differences lie in biases against women that are pervasive in the discipline, even among students in the earliest stages of their training? In this paper, we provide direct evidence on the importance of explicit and implicit biases against women among students in economics relative to other fields. We conducted a large scale survey among undergraduate students in Chilean universities, among both entering first-year students and upperclassmen. The survey elicits measures of implicit bias, explicit bias, and gender attitudes. We document that, on a wide battery of measures, economics students are more biased than students in other fields. There is some evidence that economics freshmen are more biased already upon entry, before exposure to any economic classes. The gap becomes substantially more pronounced among upperclassmen, in particular for male students. We also find evidence of an increase in bias in a sample of students that we can follow longitudinally. Differences in political ideology and religiosity explain essentially all the gap at entry, but none of the increase in the gap with exposure. Exposure to female students and female professors attenuates some of the bias of economics students.},

One important thread of that debate concerns medicalization, the process whereby 'non-medical' problems become framed as 'medical' problems. In this paper I consider the charge of medicalization, which critics often level at new forms of technological self-shaping, and explain how that charge can illuminate--and obfuscate. Then, more briefly, I examine the charge of pharmacological Calvinism, which enthusiasts, in their support of technological self-shaping, often level at critics. And I suggest how that charge, too, can illuminate and obfuscate. Exploring the broad charge of medicalization and the narrower counter charge of pharmacological Calvinism leads me to conclude that, as satisfying as it can be to level one of those charges at our intellectual opponents, and as tempting as it is to lie down and rest with our favorite insight, we need to gather the energy to have a conversation about the difference between good and bad forms of medicalization. Specifically, I suggest that if we consider the 'medicalization of love,' we can see why critics of and enthusiasts about technological self-shaping should want (and in some cases have already begun) to distinguish between good and bad forms of such medicalization.},

  abstract = {Background Despite its popularity, little is known about the measurement invariance of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) across U.S. sociodemographic groups. Use of a screener shown not to possess measurement invariance could result in under/over-detection of depression, potentially exacerbating sociodemographic disparities in depression. Therefore, we assessed the factor structure and measurement invariance of the PHQ-9 across major U.S. sociodemographic groups. Methods U.S. population representative data came from the 2005\textendash 2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) cohorts. We conducted a measurement invariance analysis of 31,366 respondents across sociodemographic factors of sex, race/ethnicity, and education level. Results Considering results of single-group confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs), depression theory, and research utility, we justify a two-factor structure for the PHQ-9 consisting of a cognitive/affective factor and a somatic factor (RMSEA = 0.034, TLI = 0.985, CFI = 0.989). On the basis of multiple-group CFAs testing configural, scalar, and strict factorial invariance, we determined that invariance held for sex, race/ethnicity, and education level groups, as all models demonstrated close model fit (RMSEA = 0.025\textendash 0.025, TLI = 0.985\textendash 0.992, CFI = 0.986\textendash 0.991). Finally, for all steps {$\Delta$}CFI was {$<-$}0.004, and {$\Delta$}RMSEA was {$<$}0.01. Conclusions We demonstrate that the PHQ-9 is acceptable to use in major U.S. sociodemographic groups and allows for meaningful comparisons in total, cognitive/affective, and somatic depressive symptoms across these groups, extending its use to the community. This knowledge is timely as medicine moves towards alternative payment models emphasizing high-quality and cost-efficient care, which will likely incentivize behavioral and population health efforts. We also provide a consistent, evidence-based approach for calculating PHQ-9 subscale scores.},

In this case, who is targeted may result from patterns of competition and conflict (same-sex or male\textendash female) within specific relationships, which are determined by broader socio-ecological factors. Here we examine patterns of sex-specific accusations in historic cases from sub-Saharan Africa (N\,=\,423 accusations). Male `witches' formed the greater part of our sample, and were mostly accused by male blood-relatives and nonrelatives, often in connection to disputes over wealth and status. Accusations of women were mainly from kin by marriage, and particularly from husbands and co-wives. The most common outcomes were that the accused was forced to move, or suffered reputational damage. Our results suggest that competition underlies accusations and relationship patterns may determine who is liable to be accused.},

In this review, we underscore specific pathways and mechanisms by which the gut microbiome can promote the development of mental disorders such as depression and anxiety. First, we review the involvement of the stress response and immune system activation in the development of depression and anxiety. Then, we examine germ-free murine models used to uncover the role of the gut microbiome in developing and modulating pertinent activity in the brain and the immune system. We also document multiple pathways by which stress-induced inflammation harms brain function and ultimately affects mental health, and review how probiotic and prebiotic treatments have shown to be beneficial. Lastly, we provide an overview of gut microbiome-derived compounds (short-chain fatty acids, tryptophan catabolites, microbial pattern recognition) and related mechanisms (vagal nerve activity and fecal microbiota transplants) involved in mediating the influence of the gut microbiome to mental health. Overall, a picture of the gut microbiome playing a facilitating role between stress response, inflammation, and depression, and anxiety is emerging. Future research is needed to firmly establish the microbiome's causal role, to further elucidate the mechanisms by which gut microbes influence brain function and mental health, and to possibly develop treatments that improve mental health through microbiotic targets.},

  abstract = {The most widely cited explanation for the evolution of reliable signals is Zahavi's so-called Handicap Principle, which proposes that signals are honest because they are costly to produce. Here we provide a critical review of the Handicap Principle and its theoretical development. We explain why this idea is erroneous, and how it nevertheless became widely accepted as the leading explanation for honest signalling. In 1975, Zahavi proposed that elaborate secondary sexual characters impose `handicaps' on male survival, not due to inadvertent signalling trade-offs, but as a mechanism that functions to demonstrate males' genetic quality to potential mates. His handicap hypothesis received many criticisms, and in response, Zahavi clarified his hypothesis and explained that it assumes that signals are wasteful as well as costly, and that they evolve because wastefulness enforces honesty. He proposed that signals evolve under `signal selection', a non-Darwinian type of selection that favours waste rather than efficiency. He maintained that the handicap hypothesis provides a general principle to explain the evolution of all types of signalling systems, i.e. the Handicap Principle. In 1977, Zahavi proposed a second hypothesis for honest signalling, which received many different labels and interpretations, although it was assumed to be another example of handicap signalling. In 1990, Grafen published models that he claimed vindicated Zahavi's Handicap Principle. His conclusions were widely accepted and the Handicap Principle subsequently became the dominant paradigm for explaining the evolution of honest signalling in the biological and social sciences. Researchers have subsequently focused on testing predications of the Handicap Principle, such as measuring the absolute costs of honest signals (and using energetic and other proximate costs as proxies for fitness), but very few have attempted to test Grafen's models. We show that Grafen's models do not support the handicap hypothesis, although they do support Zahavi's second hypothesis, which proposes that males adjust their investment into the expression of their sexual signals according to their condition and ability to bear the costs (and risks to their survival). Rather than being wasteful over-investments, honest signals evolve in this scenario because selection favours efficient and optimal investment into signal expression and minimizes signalling costs. This idea is very different from the handicap hypothesis, but it has been widely misinterpreted and equated to the Handicap Principle. Theoretical studies have since shown that signalling costs paid at the equilibrium are neither sufficient nor necessary to maintain signal honesty, and that honesty can evolve through differential benefits, as well as differential costs. There have been increasing criticisms of the Handicap Principle, but they have focused on the limitations of Grafen's model and overlooked the fact that it is not a handicap model. This model is better understood within a Darwinian framework of adaptive signalling trade-offs, without the added burden and confusing logic of the Handicap Principle. There is no theoretical or empirical support for the Handicap Principle and the time is long overdue to usher this idea into an `honorable retirement'.},

  abstract = {Mnemonic strategies generally improve prospective memory (PM) performance. However, little is known about why people use such strategies. In the Motivational-Cognitive Prospective Memory model, task importance is thought to influence performance via multiple mechanisms, including increased strategy use. Our main purpose was to test this mechanism: higher PM task importance was hypothesized to cause greater strategy use. We also tested whether importance would specifically increase the use of more effective (external) strategies. Participants reported their strategy use for two hypothetical PM tasks. As predicted, they listed more strategies for more important tasks. This result demonstrates one mechanism for motivational effects in early phases of the task. We found weaker support for the prediction that participants would selectively increase their use of better strategies for more important tasks. This finding supports a relatively pessimistic view of meta-memory in PM, at least when it comes to modulating one's use of dependable strategies.

  abstract = {Evolutionarily-based theories predict that people should adopt a faster life history strategy when their mortality risk is high. However, this raises the question of what cues evolved psychological mechanisms rely on when forming their estimates of personal mortality risk. In a sample of 600 North Americans, we examined associations between ideal or actual reproductive timing and two possible cues to mortality risk: 1) the total number of people a person knew who had died (death exposure); and 2) the number of those people to whom they felt close (bereavement). We also took a measure of financial future discounting, in order to establish whether experiences of death or bereavement are associated with a more general shortening of time horizons. We found that a greater number of bereavements were robustly associated with a lower ideal age at first birth, or an increased hazard of an actual first birth at any given age and with steeper future discounting. We did not find significant associations between any of these outcomes and overall death exposure. This suggests that the deaths of people with whom one is close may be a more salient cue for the calibration of reproductive and financial time horizons than the deaths of more distant acquaintances.},

As a consequence, targeted therapies are generally not curative or sustainably effective. Avoiding acquired resistance during therapy will require alternatives to the standard drug classes, such as cytotoxins, that are known to drive cancer's evolutionary response towards acquired resistance. Important characteristics of cancer cannot be attributed solely to the individual cells composing it, but instead emerge as collective properties of the population of cancer cells. Such collective properties do not vary among individual cells and thus do not provide fuel for cellular selection and the resulting evolution of acquired drug resistance Therapies that target collective cooperation among pathogen cells instead of targeting the cells themselves have been called `antisocial' therapies. Theory predicts that antisocial therapies will delay acquired drug resistance and retain effectiveness better than cytotoxins can. Empirical results have supported this prediction for other cellular pathogens, but it has yet to be tested carefully in cancer. Doing so should be a high priority.},

Here, we make the case that a cluster of behaviours is associated with lower socioeconomic status (SES), which we call ``the behavioural constellation of deprivation.'' We propose that the relatively limited control associated with lower SES curtails the extent to which people can expect to realise deferred rewards, leading to more present-oriented behaviour in a range of domains. We illustrate this idea using the specific factor of extrinsic mortality risk, an important factor in evolutionary theoretical models. We emphasise the idea that the present-oriented behaviours of the constellation are a contextually appropriate response to structural and ecological factors rather than a pathology or a failure of willpower. We highlight some principles from evolutionary theoretical models that can deepen our understanding of how socioeconomic inequalities can become amplified and embedded. These principles are that (1) small initial disparities can lead to larger eventual inequalities, (2) feedback loops can embed early-life circumstances, (3) constraints can breed further constraints, and (4) feedback loops can operate over generations. We discuss some of the mechanisms by which SES may influence behaviour. We then review how the contextually appropriate response perspective that we have outlined fits with other findings about control and temporal discounting. Finally, we discuss the implications of this interpretation for research and policy.},

Recent research has documented a richer repertoire of group-specific social conventions in the coalition-prone               Cebus capucinus               than in any other non-human primate species; these social rituals appear designed to test the strength of social bonds. Such diverse social conventions have not yet been noted in               Cebus apella               , despite extensive observation at multiple sites. The more robust and widely distributed               C. apella               is notable for the diversity of its tool-use repertoire, particularly in marginal habitats. Although               C. capucinus               does not often use tools, white-faced capuchins do specialize in foods requiring multi-step processing, and there are often multiple techniques used by different individuals within the same social group. Immatures preferentially observe foragers who are eating rare foods and hard-to-process foods. Young foragers, especially females, tend to adopt the same foraging techniques as their close associates.},

In the most economically advanced human populations, the adaptiveness of status vanishes altogether; social status and fertility are uncorrelated. These findings have been interpreted to suggest that evolutionary principles may not be appropriate for the explanation of human behavior, especially in modern environments. The present study tests the adaptiveness of social status with actual mating and reproductive data in a representative sample of males from an industrial society. Reproductive success, even when assessed by a more reliable measure of actual male fertility than the one commonly used, fails to correlate with social status. In striking contrast, however, status is found to be highly correlated with potential fertility, as estimated from copulation frequency. Status thus accounts for as much as 62\% of the variance in this proximate component of fitness. This pattern is remarkably similar to what is found in many traditional societies and would result in a substantial positive relationship between cultural and reproductive success in industrial populations were it not for the novel conditions imposed by contraception and monogamy. Various underlying mechanisms are suggested for these findings, illustrating the value of current behavioral and reproductive data in the study of adaptation. It is concluded that evolutionary explanations of human behavior remain entirely relevant in modern societies.}

The authors examined the impact of this approach with a 10-year comparison of public endorsement of treatment and prejudice.Method:The authors analyzed responses to vignettes in the mental health modules of the 1996 and 2006 General Social Survey describing individuals meeting DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia, major depression, and alcohol dependence to explore whether more of the public 1) embraces neurobiological understandings of mental illness; 2) endorses treatment from providers, including psychiatrists; and 3) reports community acceptance or rejection of people with these disorders. Multivariate analyses examined whether acceptance of neurobiological causes increased treatment support and lessened stigma.Results:In 2006, 67\% of the public attributed major depression to neurobiological causes, compared with 54\% in 1996. High proportions of respondents endorsed treatment, with general increases in the proportion endorsing treatment from doctors and specific increases in the proportions endorsing psychiatrists for treatment of alcohol dependence (from 61\% in 1996 to 79\% in 2006) and major depression (from 75\% in 1996 to 85\% in 2006). Social distance and perceived danger associated with people with these disorders did not decrease significantly. Holding a neurobiological conception of these disorders increased the likelihood of support for treatment but was generally unrelated to stigma. Where associated, the effect was to increase, not decrease, community rejection.Conclusions:More of the public embraces a neurobiological understanding of mental illness. This view translates into support for services but not into a decrease in stigma. Reconfiguring stigma reduction strategies may require providers and advocates to shift to an emphasis on competence and inclusion.},

In particular, the compassionate motivation to share with needy nonfamily could not have evolved without defenses against opportunists inclined to take without contributing. Cognitively, such parasitic strategies can be identified by the intentional avoidance of productive effort. When detected, this pattern should trigger anger and down-regulate support for assistance. We tested predictions derived from these hypotheses in four studies in two cultures, showing that subjects' perceptions of recipients' effort to find work drive welfare opinions; that such perceptions (and not related perceptions) regulate compassion and anger (and not related emotions); that the effects of perceptions of recipients' effort on opinions about welfare are mediated by anger and compassion, independently of political ideology; and that these emotions not only influence the content of welfare opinions but also how easily they are formed.},

Sex difference was shown to be very variable, the values of these indices being both task and population specific.

Sex differences became more pronounced as handle size increased. The optimal handle-size was 50 mm for both male and female subjects. Data concerning whole body exertion (Pheasant et al, 1982) were also analysed for sex differences. It was concluded that very similar tests of strength could exhibit very different levels of sex difference. The task or equipment designer should not make assumptions about sex differences in strength for a particular action, but should rely on empirical investigation.},

  abstract = {Can evolution help us to understand ethics and morality? After arguing against some of the misunderstandings regarding evolution (e.g. that it implies egoism/selfishness or that "might is right"), Peter Singer argues that evolution is neutral with respect to values (the naturalistic fallacy), but that understanding evolution does help us to understand human nature; and since the field of ethics is often interested in changing behavior, evolution gives us valuable clues as to what is, or is not, likely to work. Singer also considers the argument that since our moral sense has evolved, it serves to enhance our reproductive fitness, and hence is not a guide to what is really right or wrong. He argues that there is some truth to this claim, but properly understood, it should lead us to skepticism about some ethical views, but not about ethics itself.

  abstract = {Crying is a ubiquitous human behavior through which an emotion is expressed on the face together with visible tears, and constitutes a slippery riddle for researchers. To provide an answer to the question ``How our gaze reacts to another person's tears?'' we made use of eye tracking technology to study a series of visual stimuli. By presenting an illustrative example through an experimental setting specifically designed to study the ``tearing effect'', the present work aims to offer methodological insight on how to use eye tracking technology to study nonverbal cues. A sample of 30 healthy young women with normal visual accuity performed a within-subjects task in which they evaluated images of real faces with and without tears while their eye movements were tracked. Tears were found to be a magnet for visual attention in the task of facial attribution, facilitating a greater perception of emotional intensity. Moreover, the inspection pattern changed qualitatively and quantitatively, with our participants becoming fully focused on the tears when they were visible. The mere presence of a single tear running down a cheek was associated with an increased emotional inference and greater perception of sincerity. Using normalized and validated tools (Reading the Eyes in the Mind Test and the SALAMANCA screening test for personality disorders), we measured the influence of certain characteristics of the participants on their performance of the experimental task. On the one hand, a higher level of cognitive empathy helped to classify tearful faces with higher emotional intensity and tearless faces with less emotional intensity. On the other hand, we observed that less sincerity was attributed to the tearful faces as the SALAMANCA test scores rose in clusters A (strange and extravagant) and B (immature and emotionally unstable) of our sample. The present findings highlight the advantages of using eye tracking technology to study non-verbal cues and draw attention to methodological issues that should be taken into account. Further exploration of the relationship between empathy and tear-perception could be a fruitful avenue of future research using eye tracking.},

Despite its common occurrence, little is known about the conditions leading to out-group relationship building in humans. What are the social and ecological factors promoting valuation of out-group members as potential social partners? Do they differ from those promoting valuation of in-group members? We propose that opportunities for non-local resource access and resource buffering, crucial in the human foraging niche, will increase valuation of out-group strangers. Using survey and experimental data collected among three Bolivian horticultural populations, we find that individuals with fewer non-locally available resources and more information about out-groups demonstrate more generosity toward out-group strangers, but not in-group strangers. The effects are specific to subjective resource access, not objective measures of access, and out-group exposure, not stereotypes. Further, depending on the measure, existing network connections affect both out-group and in-group giving, suggesting that new partnerships from both in-groups and out-groups may bolster one's networks. Our results illustrate how evolved human psychology is sensitive to the costs and benefits of both out-group and in-group relationships, but underscore that the social and ecological factors favoring new relationships with in-group versus out-group strangers may differ.},

However, the empirical literature points to considerable variability in the expression of parochial preferences. We argue that greater emphasis should be placed on understanding this variation and how it can be impacted both by research design and by cross-cultural variation in the constraints on and incentives for inter-group tolerance. We draw on two illustrative case studies from Colombia and Bolivia to discuss the flexible nature of parochial altruism in humans. By deploying multiple methods in multiple communities, we show that the degree of parochialism expressed by individuals can be linked to the constraints on and incentives for inter-group tolerance, but also to methodological choices. Our case studies highlight both how our methods may impact our inferences and suggest that while parochial altruism may be universally possible in humans, it is not universally present across communities, across individuals, or even within the same individual across time. We close by discussing how researchers can better measure real-world variability in parochial altruism.},

Here we demonstrate that the canines of both males and females are relatively larger in species where agonistic interactions are more likely to escalate. Hence, the canine teeth of both sexes are influenced by selection for the development of weaponry, though the nature of the selection (natural or sexual) favoring development of the canines as weapons depends on the objects of competition (mates vs. food, for example). However, we also suggest that where the outcome of fights is typically determined between coalitions of individuals, selection for weaponry is reduced, even though agonistic competition can be very intense. Coalitionary aggression between males occurs in only a handful of anthropoid primates, but it is common among female anthropoids, and helps explain, in part, the extreme sexual dimorphism in the canine teeth of a number of catarrhine species. This is the first demonstration that cooperation among animals may affect their morphology. The lack of sexual dimorphism in canine size among prosimian primates is also consistent with the model. This analysis demonstrates that a better understanding of the interspecific variation in sexual dimorphism among primates is gained by considering behavioral variation in both sexes.},

  abstract = {Body weight dimorphism in anthropoid primates has been thought to be a consequence of sexual selection resulting from male-male competition for access to mates. However, while monogamous anthropoids show low degrees of weight dimorphism, as predicted by the sexual selection hypothesis, polygynous anthropoids show high variation in weight dimorphism that is not associated with measures of mating system or sex ratio. This observation has led many to debate the role of other factors such as dietary constraints, predation pressure, substrate constraints, allometric effects, and phylogeny in the evolution of anthropoid weight dimorphism. Here, we re-evaluate variation in adult body weight dimorphism in anthropoids, testing the sexual selection hypothesis using categorical estimates of the degree of male-male intrasexual competition (``competition levels''). We also test the hypotheses that interspecific variation in body weight dimorphism is associated with female body weight and categorical estimates of diet, substrate use, and phylogeny. Weight dimorphism is strongly associated with competition levels, corroborating the sexual selection hypothesis. Weight dimorphism is positively correlated with increasing female body weight, but evidence suggests that the correlation reflects an interaction between overall size and behavior. Arboreal species are, on average, less dimorphic than terrestrial species, while more frugivorous species tend to be more dimorphic than folivorous or insectivorous species. Several alternative hypotheses can explain these latter results. Weight dimorphism is correlated with taxonomy, but so too are competition levels. We suggest that most taxonomic correlations of weight dimorphism represent ``phylogenetic niche conservatism''; however, colobines show consistently low degrees of weight dimorphism for reasons that are not clear.

  abstract = {Sexual dimorphism is a pervasive phenomenon among anthropoid primates. Comparative analyses over the past 30 years have greatly expanded our understanding of both variation in the expression of dimorphism among primates, and the underlying causes of sexual dimorphism. Dimorphism in body mass and canine tooth size is familiar, as is pelage and ``sex skin'' dimorphism. More recent analyses are documenting subtle differences in the pattern of skeletal dimorphism among primates. Comparative analyses have corroborated the sexual selection hypotheses, and have provided a more detailed understanding of the relationship between sexual selection, natural selection, and mating systems in primates. A clearer picture is emerging of the relative contribution of various selective and nonselective mechanisms in the evolution and expression of dimorphism. Most importantly, recent studies have shown that dimorphism is the product of changes in both male and female traits. Developmental studies demonstrate the variety of ontogenetic pathways that can lead to dimorphism, and provide additional insight into the selective mechanisms that influence dimorphism throughout the lifetime of an animal. Evidence from the fossil record suggests that dimorphism probably evolved in parallel twice, and the dimorphism in some extinct hominoids probably exceeded that of any living primate. Our advances in understanding the behavioral/ecological correlates of dimorphism in living primates have not improved our ability to reconstruct social systems in extinct species on the basis of dimorphism alone, beyond the inference of polygyny or intense male-male competition. However, our understanding of the behavioral/ecological correlates of growth and development, and of the expression of dimorphism as a function of separate changes in male and female traits, offers great potential for inferring evolutionary changes in behavior over time.

These primate models play an important role in understanding the origins and evolution of human behavior. Human size dimorphism is often hypothesized to be associated with high rates of male violence and polygyny. This raises the question of whether human dimorphism and patterns of male violence are inherited from a common ancestor with chimpanzees or are uniquely derived. Here I review patterns of, and causal models for, dimorphism in humans and other primates. While dimorphism in primates is associated with agonistic male mate competition, a variety of factors can affect male and female size, and thereby dimorphism. The causes of human sexual size dimorphism are uncertain, and could involve several non-mutually-exclusive mechanisms, such as mate competition, resource competition, intergroup violence, and female choice. A phylogenetic reconstruction of the evolution of dimorphism, including fossil hominins, indicates that the modern human condition is derived. This suggests that at least some behavioral similarities with Pan associated with dimorphism may have arisen independently, and not directly from a common ancestor.},

  abstract = {Sexual dimorphism is commonly used to directly infer or support reconstructions of social behavior in early hominins. This is often done by comparing the magnitude of sexual size dimorphism to that seen in extant primates and extrapolating a likely social behavior. Such comparisons are of limited value, though, allowing only the inference of strong male\textendash male competition when dimorphism is strong. Recent studies have begun to focus on the selective factors that impact female body size, and thereby size dimorphism. Considerations of changes in male and female size in the fossil record potentially allow insight into the meaning of changes in sexual dimorphism through time. To illustrate, I compare estimates of body mass dimorphism for four hominin taxa to assess changes in male and female size. Assuming that early Homo represents a single taxon, sexual size dimorphism increased in early Homo through an increase in male size, but was subsequently reduced through an increase in female size in Homo erectus. This would imply a significant increase in sexual selection acting on males in early Homo. An increase in female size with a loss of dimorphism in Homo erectus would imply a simultaneous shift in female optimal body size through selection for increased female fecundity, and/or an increase in female resource abundance, coupled with a shift in selection acting on male size. Although none of these inferences are certain, the exercise illustrates the potential for considering how dimorphism changes through time, rather than simply focusing on the magnitude of size dimorphism in isolation.},

There were curvilinear relationships between height and age at first birth, fertility, and survival rates for children.

This implies that obstructed labour is not an inevitable character of our species and that mediation of the environment (diet, activity, health) and changes in birth posture can potentially reduce obstetric complications in the short and longer term.

Here, I examine the fossil evidence for postcranial change in early Homo and draw on comparative data from living mammals to assess whether increased diet quality has led to selection for improved locomotor performance in other lineages. Body mass estimates indicate early Homo, both males and females, were approximately 33\% larger than australopiths, consistent with archeological evidence indicating an ecological change with the origins of our genus. However, many of the postcranial features thought to be derived in Homo, including longer hind limbs, are present in Australopithecus, challenging the hypothesis that early Homo is marked by significant change in walking and running performance. Analysis of energy budgets across mammals suggests that the larger body mass and increased diet quality in early Homo may reflect an increase in the hominin energy budget. Expanding the energy budget would enable greater investment in reproduction without decreasing energy available for larger brains or increased activity. Food sharing and increased adiposity, which decrease variance in food energy availability, may have been integral to this metabolic strategy.}

  abstract = {Hunter-gatherer populations are remarkable for their excellent metabolic and cardiovascular health and thus are often used as models in public health, in an effort to understand the root, evolutionary causes of non-communicable diseases. Here, we review recent work on health, activity, energetics and diet among hunter-gatherers and other small-scale societies (e.g. subsistence farmers, horticulturalists and pastoralists), as well as recent fossil and archaeological discoveries, to provide a more comprehensive perspective on lifestyle and health in these populations. We supplement these analyses with new data from the Hadza, a hunter-gatherer population in northern Tanzania. Longevity among small-scale populations approaches that of industrialized populations, and metabolic and cardiovascular disease are rare. Obesity prevalence is very low ({$<$}5\%), and mean body fat percentage is modest (women: 24\textendash 28\%, men: 9\textendash 18\%). Activity levels are high, exceeding 100 min d\`A1 of moderate and vigorous physical activity, but daily energy expenditures are similar to industrialized populations. Diets in hunter-gatherer and other small-scale societies tend to be less energy dense and richer in fibre and micronutrients than modern diets but are not invariably low carbohydrate as sometimes argued. A more integrative understanding of hunter-gatherer health and lifestyle, including elements beyond diet and activity, will improve public health efforts in industrialized populations.},

By reviewing the exchange and collective-action dilemmas in both small-scale and large-scale societies, we show they are not different. Second, are individual decision-making mechanisms driven by self-interest? We extract from the literature three types of individual decision-making mechanism, which differ in their social influence and sensitivity to self-interest, to conclude that humans interacting with non-relatives are largely driven by self-interest. We then ask: what was the key mechanism that allowed prosocial behaviors to continue as societies grew? We show the key role played by new social interaction mechanisms \textendash{} change in the rules of exchange and collective-action dilemmas \textendash{} devised by the interacting individuals, which allow for self-interested individuals to remain prosocial as societies grow.},

Hormones are central mechanisms that contribute to the onset and timing of key life history events, the allocation of time and energy between competing functions, and in general modulate phenotypic development and variation. Here we provide a very brief review of testosterone and immunity, which highlights the physiological costs that elevated testosterone levels can incur as a result of reproductive investments. We focus primarily on nonhuman primates where possible. Although there is substantial evidence that testosterone exerts some influences on immune responses, results from in vivo studies involving human and nonhuman primates have yielded equivocal results regarding such immunomodulatory actions. There may be several reasons for this, including variation in study design, immunological measures used, levels of other hormones present, host energy status, and even social conditions. We therefore review some of these potential methodological issues, concluding that increased care must be taken to analyze seasonal variability in energy budgets, to collect an adequate number of samples from known individuals, to account for status in the dominance hierarchy when applicable, and to use multiple measures of immunity. We must also seek to understand the collaborative effects of multiple hormones (particularly dehydroepiandrosterone and estradiol) with relation to their downstream immunological effects, assessing both individual and multiplicative actions in both males and females. Such efforts would benefit from the development of additional noninvasive immune measures for primates.},

However, the direct role of paternity confidence on the patterns of paternal investment is relatively unknown, in part due to a lack of research in populations with high levels of paternity uncertainty. Additionally, much of the work on paternity certainty uses cues of paternity confidence rather than direct assessments from fathers. We examine the effect of paternity assertions on the multiple measures of paternal investment in Himba pastoralists. Despite a high degree of paternity uncertainty, Himba have strong norms associated with social fatherhood, with men expected to invest equally in biological and non-biological offspring. Our behavioural data show patterns that largely conform to these norms. For domains of investment that are highly visible to the community, such as brideprice payments, we find no evidence of investment biased by paternity confidence. However, more private investment decisions do show some evidence of sex-specific titration. We discuss these results in light of broader considerations about paternal care and the mating\textendash parenting trade-off.},

Thus, we argue that macroevolutionary archaeology is well positioned to benefit from and contribute to the EES. Toward that end this chapter outlines baseline assumptions and contributions of macroevolutionary archaeology and introduces concepts from the EES and advanced fitness landscape theory as essential theoretical tools for solving problems in the long-term record of human bio-cultural history and evolution.},

We suggest that elevated mood enabled a person to rise in rank and cope with the increased activities and responsibilities of a leadership role, while depressed mood enabled a person to accept low rank and to forego the rewards associated with high rank. This led to the concept of a trio of agonist/investor strategy sets, each consisting of escalating and deescalating strategies, one set at each of the three levels of the triune forebrain. Depressed mood can be seen as a de-escalating (appeasement) strategy at the lowest (reptilian) level; this should facilitate de-escalation at the highest (rational) level, but sometimes this rational level de-escalation is blocked (e.g., by stubbornness, courage, pride or ambition) and then clinical depression may ensue. These evolved psychobiological mechanisms survived the partial transition from agonistic to prestige competition. We discuss difficulties which have arisen with our ideas, and their implications for clinical work and research.},

Although tearing (lacrimation) provides ocular lubrication and is a response to irritation in many animals, emotional tearing may be unique to humans and does not develop until several months after birth. This study provides the first experimental demonstration that tears are a visual signal of sadness by contrasting the perceived sadness of human facial images with tears against copies of those images that had the tears digitally removed. Tear removal produced faces rated as less sad. Anecdotal findings suggest further that tear-removal often produced faces of uncertain emotional valence, perhaps awe, concern, or puzzlement, not just less sad. Tearing signaled sadness and resolved ambiguity. The evolution and development of emotional tearing in humans provide a novel, potent and neglected channel of affective communication.},

Individuals with reddened sclera were perceived as sadder, less healthy, and less attractive than individuals with normal (white) sclera.

These Paleoindian colonists initially brought with them technologies developed for adaptation to environments and resources found in North America. As the ice age ended across the New World people adapted more generalized stone tools to exploit changing environments and resources. In the neotropics these changes would have been pronounced as patchy forests and grasslands gave way to broadleaf tropical forests. We document a late Pleistocene/early Holocene stone tool tradition from Belize, located in southern Mesoamerica. This represents the first endogenous Paleoindian stone tool technocomplex recovered from well dated stratigraphic contexts for Mesoamerica. Previously designated Lowe, these artifacts share multiple features with contemporary North and South American Paleoindian tool types. Once hafted, these bifaces appear to have served multiple functions for cutting, hooking, thrusting, or throwing. The tools were developed at a time of technological regionalization reflecting the diverse demands of a period of pronounced environmental change and population movement. Combined stratigraphic, technological, and population paleogenetic data suggests that there were strong ties between lowland neotropic regions at the onset of the Holocene.},

Semiquantitative narrative accounts of interactions among these factors by Malthus and later by Boserup currently are being updated with more explicitly quantitative analytical and simulation models. We describe one of these approaches, food-limited demography, and present examples of how it is being used to interpret archaeological data on subsistence, settlement, and the sociopolitical evolution of Pacific and North American societies. We note that dynamic modeling can reveal system properties that run counter to commonly held beliefs about population ecology. In agrarian societies the weight of Malthusian constraints on population develop not gradually, but abruptly, with severe consequences for human welfare; inter-annual food storage mitigates some instances of famine but makes others more severe; the potential for surplus production is greatest when populations are relatively small; low tax rates applied to a large population of producers are more stable than a high rate applied to a smaller population; and, at population equilibrium, a tax on labor may be more efficient than one on agrarian goods. These and other insights from contemporary modeling of linkages among human demography, behavior, economy, and environment allow us to examine the consequences of assumptions about rates of birth and death, the allocation of wealth and power, and how resources and labor are utilized in the evolution of early agricultural societies.},

  abstract = {Literature in evolutionary psychology suggests that mate choice has been the primary mechanism of sexual selection in humans, but this conclusion conforms neither to theoretical predictions nor available evidence. Contests override other mechanisms of sexual selection; that is, when individuals can exclude their competitors by force or threat of force, mate choice, sperm competition, and other mechanisms are impossible. Mates are easier to monopolize in two dimensional mating environments, such as land, than in three-dimensional environments, such as air, water, and trees. Thus, two-dimensional mating environments may tend to favor the evolution of contests. The two-dimensionality of the human mating environment, along with phylogeny, the spatial and temporal clustering of mates and competitors, and anatomical considerations, predict that contest competition should have been the primary mechanism of sexual selection in men. A functional analysis supports this prediction. Men's traits are better designed for contest competition than for other sexual selection mechanisms; size, muscularity, strength, aggression, and the manufacture and use of weapons probably helped ancestral males win contests directly, and deep voices and facial hair signal dominance more effectively than they increase attractiveness. However, male monopolization of females was imperfect, and female mate choice, sperm competition, and sexual coercion also likely shaped men's traits. In contrast, male mate choice was probably central in women's mating competition because ancestral females could not constrain the choices of larger and more aggressive males through force, and attractive women could obtain greater male investment. Neotenous female features and body fat deposition on the breasts and hips appear to have been shaped by male mate choice.}

  abstract = {Across human societies and many nonhuman animals, males have greater interest in uncommitted sex (more unrestricted sociosexuality) than do females. Testosterone shows positive associations with male-typical sociosexual behavior in nonhuman animals. Yet, it remains unclear whether the human sex difference in sociosexual psychology (attitudes and desires) is mediated by testosterone, whether any relationships between testosterone and sociosexuality differ between men and women, and what the nature of these possible relationships might be. In studies to resolve these questions, we examined relationships between salivary testosterone concentrations and sociosexual psychology and behavior in men and women. We measured testosterone in all men in our sample, but only in those women taking oral contraception (OC-using women) in order to reduce the influence of ovulatory cycle variation in ovarian hormone production. We found that OC-using women did not differ from normally-ovulating women in sociosexual psychology or behavior, but that circulating testosterone mediated the sex difference in human sociosexuality and predicted sociosexual psychology in men but not OC-using women. Moreover, when sociosexual psychology was controlled, men's sociosexual behavior (number of sexual partners) was negatively related to testosterone, suggesting that testosterone drives sociosexual psychology in men and is inhibited when those desires are fulfilled. This more complex relationship between androgens and male sexuality may reconcile some conflicting prior reports.},

ConclusionsThe macro perspective of this chapter points out that there are several powerful global forces shaping women's roles that must be considered in analyses of the status of women and their importance to the development process and in planning for changes to improve their circumstances. They include: (1) the dynamics of the increasingly market-oriented global system; (2) the increasing adoption of export-led development strategies; (3) the spread and changing cost-cutting strategies of MNCs; (4) the effects of stabilization and structural adjustment policies (SAPs) required by the IMF and WB; and (5) inequities in the relative power of the major global institutions. The effect of these forces on women are compounded by preexisting systems of discrimination that subordinate women in the household, workplace (via lack of equal access to all jobs, and lack of resources for own businesses), political sphere, and religious institutions. This chapter has shown that there are analytical linkages between women's disadvantaged status and global restructuring. The problems that ensue for women are systemic and integral to the structure of the largely market-oriented international economy and the prevailing economic theories upon which policies for global restructuring are based. They must be addressed with this realization in mind.},

However, there are types of social interactions that, although covered, are not illuminated. Here, I expand the inclusive fitness approach and the corresponding neighbor-modulated approach to specify two other kinds of social selection. Kind selection, which includes greenbeards and many nonadditive games, is where selection depends on an actor's trait having different effects on others depending on whether they share the trait. Kith selection includes social effects that do not require either kin or kind, such as mutualism and manipulation. It involves social effects of a trait that affect a partner, with feedback to the actor's fitness. I derive expanded versions of Hamilton's rule for kith and kind selection, generalizing Hamilton's insight that we can model social selection through a sum of fitness effects, each multiplied by an appropriate association coefficient. Kinship is, thus, only one of the important types of association, but all can be incorporated within an expanded inclusive fitness.},

Despite abundant behavioral and neuroscientific research, the influence of cultural factors on these skills remains poorly understood. This issue is of particular importance as most cognitive tasks are developed in highly specific contexts, not representative of what is encountered by the world's population. Through a large international and multi-site study, we assessed core social cognition aspects using current gold-standard tasks in 587 participants from 12 countries. Age, gender, and education were found to impact emotion recognition as well as the ability to infer mental states. After controlling for these factors, differences between countries accounted for more than 20\% of the variance on both abilities. Importantly, it was possible to isolate cultural from linguistic impacts, which classically constitute a major limitation. We suggest important methodological shifts to better represent social cognition at the fundamental and the clinical levels.  https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/tg2ay},

  abstract = {Background: ``Fright'' is an English-speaking Caribbean idiom for an illness, or ethnomedical syndrome, of persistent distress. A parallel ethnopsychiatric idiom exists in the French Antilles as s\'esisma. Fright is distinct from susto among Hispanics, though both develop in the wake of traumatic events. West Indian ethnophysiology (ethnoanatomy) theorizes that an overload of stressful emotions (fear, panic, anguish or worry) causes a cold humoral state in which blood coagulates causing prolonged distress and increased risks of other humorally cold illnesses. Methods: Qualitative data on local explanatory models and treatment of fright were collected using participantobservation, informal key informant interviews and a village health survey. Ethnobotanical and epidemiological data come from freelist (or ``free-list'') tasks, analyzed for salience, with nearly all adults (N = 112) of an eastern village in Dominica, and a village survey on medicinal plant recognition and use (N = 106). Results: Along with prayer and exercise, three herbs are salient fright treatments: Gossypium barbadense L., Lippia micromera Schauer, and, Plectranthus [Coleus] amboinicus [Loureiro] Sprengel. The survey indicated that 27\% of village adults had medicated themselves for fright. Logistic regression of fright suffering onto demographic variables of age, education, gender, parental status and wealth measured in consumer goods found age to be the only significant predictor of having had fright. The probability of having (and medicating for) fright thus increases with every year. Conclusions: While sufferers are often uncomfortable recalling personal fright experiences, reporting use of medicinal plants is less problematic. Inquiry on fright medical ethnobotany (or phytotherapies) serves as a proxy measurement for fright occurrence. Cross-cultural and ethnopharmacology literature on the medicinal plants suggests probable efficacy in accord with Dominican ethnomedical notions of fright. Further, the cultural salience and beliefs about these medicines may give these medications extra psychoneuroimmune (i.e. mind-body) benefits, or placebo-like effects, for this stress-related folk illness.},

Contextual factors such as country-level income or income inequalities have been hypothesised to contribute to these differences. Aims To investigate associations of depression with socioeconomic factors at the country level (income inequality, gross national income) and individual (education, employment, assets and spending) level, and to investigate their relative contribution in explaining the cross-national variation in the prevalence of depression. Method Multilevel study using interview data of 187 496 individuals from 53 countries participating in the World Health Organization World Health Surveys. Results Depression prevalence varied between 0.4 and 15.7\% across countries. Individual-level factors were responsible for 86.5\% of this variance but there was also reasonable variation at the country level (13.5\%), which appeared to increase with decreasing economic development of countries. Gross national income or country-level income inequality had no association with depression. At the individual level, fewer material assets, lower education, female gender, economic inactivity and being divorced or widowed were associated with increased odds of depression. Greater household spending, unlike material assets, was associated with increasing odds of depression (adjusted analysis). Conclusions The variance of depression prevalence attributable to country-level factors seemed to increase with decreasing economic development of countries. However, country-level income inequality or gross national income explained little of this variation, and individual-level factors appeared more important than contextual factors as determinants of depression. The divergent relationship of assets and spending with depression emphasise that different socioeconomic measures are not interchangeable in their associations with depression.},

Data are presented in support of the idea that inflammation only contributes to depression in a subset of patients versus the possibility that the depressogenic effect of inflammatory activation is more widespread and varies depending on the degree of vulnerability any given individual evinces in interconnected physiologic systems known to be implicated in the etiology of MDD.

Results focus on the psychometric characteristics of the 2-item scales on the BFI-10, including their part-whole correlations with the BFI-44 scales, retest reliability, structural validity, convergent validity with the NEO-PI-R and its facets, and external validity using peer ratings. Overall, results indicate that the BFI-10 scales retain significant levels of reliability and validity. Thus, reducing the items of the BFI-44 to less than a fourth yielded effect sizes that were lower than those for the full BFI-44 but still sufficient for research settings with truly limited time constraints.},

  abstract = {Objective. Currently, the methods for assessing milk ejection in women include serial sampling of plasma oxytocin and measurement of intraductal pressure, both of which are invasive and may induce stress. We hypothesized that milk ejection would cause an increase in milk-duct diameter that could be observed noninvasively with ultrasound, and this could be used to investigate the physiology of milk ejection in women. Methods. One milk duct was scanned in the unsuckled breast in 2 groups of mothers: group BB (n = 21) for the beginning of a breastfeed and group EB (n = 24) for the entire breastfeed. A duct also was monitored for a 5-minute period on 2 separate days in the absence of factors that may induce milk ejection in group EB to provide a baseline duct diameter. Milk intake at a breastfeed was measured by test weighing. Results. A significant increase in milk-duct diameter was observed when milk ejection was sensed and/or the infant changed its swallowing pattern in both groups. Multiple increases and decreases (mean: 2.5 per breastfeed; standard deviation: 1.5; n = 62) in duct diameter occurred in group EB. Duct diameter remained relatively stable between breastfeeds (coefficient of variation: 1.4\%\textendash 8.3\%). Infant milk intake was positively related to the number of milk ejections (r2 = .365; n = 57). Conclusions. Ultrasound is an objective, noninvasive technique for detecting milk ejection by observing an increase in milk-duct diameter. However, this technique requires an experienced ultrasonographer, adequate imaging time, and surroundings conducive to breastfeeding. Multiple milk ejections were common during breastfeeding, although they were not sensed by mothers. The number of milk ejections influenced the amount of milk the infant consumed.},

In this study, 136 persons with temporomandibular pain disorder syndrome (TMPDS) and 131 healthy controls reported the occurrence of life events in 10 monthly interviews, using an event category checklist. At the end of the study, they reported retrospectively and in detail about life events over the previous monthly periods. Only one quarter of the event categories appeared in both the monthly interviews and retrospective report for the same period. Detailed analyses revealed problems of inaccuracy inherent in checklists that exacerbate problems of recall. The findings indicate that checklist category approaches should not be used when the goal is to understand the role of stress in adverse health outcomes. Suggestions are made about more adequate methods.}

Method Analyses were conducted on study participants from the 2009\textendash 2010 National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES) with Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 depression scores {$\geq$} 10 to: 1) examine the relationship of inflammation (C-reactive protein; CRP) with demographic and clinical characteristics and 2) examine the prevalence of MetS criteria within CRP groups. Results 5579 participants provided PHQ-9 data; of those, 606 had PHQ-9 scores {$\geq$} 10 and were included in further analysis. Of the 606 depressed participants, 585 participants had valid CRP data; 275 participants (47.01\%) had CRP levels {$\geq$} 3.0 mg/L, while 170 (29.06\%) had CRP levels {$\geq$} 5.0 mg/L. Elevated inflammation was significantly correlated with body weight, waist circumference, BMI, insulin, 2-hour glucose tolerance, and self-report general health (p's {$<$} 0.05). 112 subjects (41.18\%) met AHA/NHLBI criteria for metabolic syndrome (MetS). Those with elevated CRP were more likely to meet criteria for MetS (Odds Ratios of 2.81 for those with CRP levels {$\geq$} 3.0 mg/L and 1.94 for those with CRP levels {$\geq$} 5.0 mg/L). Conclusion Over 29\% of depressed individuals have elevated levels of CRP and 41\% met criteria for MetS. Individuals with elevated inflammation are more likely to be obese and meet criteria for MetS. These results highlight the significant inflammatory and metabolic burden of individuals with depression.},

Here we contribute to this body of research by presenting three case studies showing evidence of a multistage model of cultural learning in which vertical transmission in childhood loses preeminence toward horizontal and oblique models as subjects' age. The first case study documents and analyzes Baka children's daily activities (southeast Cameroon) in an attempt to understand (1) how time investments might affect the acquisition of knowledge and (2) the importance of scaffolding on knowledge acquisition. Building on this idea, the second case study explores the transmission of knowledge through the life cycle, documenting the accumulation of knowledge required for collecting wild honey among children and adults from a Jenu Kuruba tribal community in South India. The last case study uses data from the Tsimane' (Bolivian Amazon) to analyze the correspondence between levels of adult knowledge and the knowledge of (a) the same-sex parent, (b) age peers, and (c) parental cohort. Results from this study suggest that \textendash{} at adulthood \textendash{} cultural knowledge is most likely a mix of information gathered from a variety of sources. Overall, the three case studies give evidence to support the multistage learning model for cultural transmission but also emphasize the importance of social learning during childhood, a period during which individuals acquire the baseline knowledge that allow the latter development of complex skills through scaffolding and the integration of information from multiple models.},

It helped to galvanize the empirical field of comparative life-history and dominated thinking on the subject from the late 1960s through the 1970s. Large quantities of field data were collected that claimed to test predictions of the theory. By the early 1980s, sentiment about the theory had changed so completely that a proposal to test it or the use of it to interpret empirical results would likely be viewed as archaic and na\"ive. The theory was displaced by demographic models that concentrated on mortality patterns as the cause of life-history evolution. Although demographic models are known for their density-independent approach and focus on extrinsic mortality, these models can incorporate many ecological features captured by r- and K-selection, such as density-dependent population regulation, resource availability, and environmental fluctuations. We highlight the incorporation of these factors in recent theory, then show how they are manifest in our research on life-history evolution in Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata). Explanations of the repeatable suites of life-history differences across populations of guppies originate from demographic models of predator-driven age-specific mortality. Recently, careful examination of guppy demography and habitat has revealed that density-dependent regulation and resource availability may have influenced the evolution of guppy life histories. In the field, these factors covary with predation risk; however, they can be uncoupled experimentally, providing insight into how they may have synergistically driven guppy life-history evolution. Although life-history theory has shifted away from a focus on r- and K-selection, the themes of density-dependent regulation, resource availability, and environmental fluctuations are integral to current demographic theory and are potentially important in any natural system.},

Among the most robust findings in this literature is that delaying predictions serves to substantially increase the relative accuracy of JOLs compared with soliciting JOLs immediately after study, a finding termed the delayed JOL effect. The meta-analyses reported in the current study examined the predominant theoretical accounts as well as potential moderators of the delayed JOL effect. The first meta-analysis examined the relative accuracy of delayed compared with immediate JOLs across 4,554 participants (112 effect sizes) through gamma correlations between JOLs and memory accuracy. Those data showed that delaying JOLs leads to robust benefits to relative accuracy (g Ï­ 0.93). The second meta-analysis examined memory performance for delayed compared with immediate JOLs across 3,807 participants (98 effect sizes). Those data showed that delayed JOLs result in a modest but reliable benefit for memory performance relative to immediate JOLs (g Ï­ 0.08). Findings from these meta-analyses are well accommodated by theories suggesting that delayed JOL accuracy reflects access to more diagnostic information from long-term memory rather than being a by-product of a retrieval opportunity. However, these data also suggest that theories proposing that the delayed JOL effect results from a memorial benefit or the match between the cues available for JOLs and those available at test may also provide viable explanatory mechanisms necessary for a comprehensive account.},

  abstract = {Human cooperation is highly unusual. We live in large groups composed mostly of non-relatives. Evolutionists have proposed a number of explanations for this pattern, including cultural group selection and extensions of more general processes such as reciprocity, kin selection, and multi-level selection acting on genes. Evolutionary processes are consilient; they affect several different empirical domains, such as patterns of behavior and the proximal drivers of that behavior. In this target article, we sketch the evidence from five domains that bear on the explanatory adequacy of cultural group selection and competing hypotheses to explain human cooperation. Does cultural transmission constitute an inheritance system that can evolve in a Darwinian fashion? Are the norms that underpin institutions among the cultural traits so transmitted? Do we observe sufficient variation at the level of groups of considerable size for group selection to be a plausible process? Do human groups compete, and do success and failure in competition depend upon cultural variation? Do we observe adaptations for cooperation in humans that most plausibly arose by cultural group selection? If the answer to one of these questions is ``no,'' then we must look to other hypotheses. We present evidence, including quantitative evidence, that the answer to all of the questions is ``yes'' and argue that we must take the cultural group selection hypothesis seriously. If culturally transmitted systems of rules (institutions) that limit individual deviance organize cooperation in human societies, then it is not clear that any extant alternative to cultural group selection can be a complete explanation.},

  abstract = {Humans evolved from an ape ancestor that was highly intelligent, moderately social and moderately dependent on cultural adaptations for subsistence technology (tools). By the late Pleistocene, humans had become highly dependent on culture for subsistence and for rules to organize a complex social life. Adaptation by cultural traditions transformed our life history, leading to an extended juvenile period to learn subsistence and social skills, post-reproductive survival to help conserve and transmit skills, a dependence on social support for mothers of large-brained, very dependent and nutrient-demanding offspring, males devoting substantial effort to provisioning rather than mating, and the cultivation of large social networks to tap pools in information unavailable to less social species. One measure of the success of the exploitation of culture is that the minimum inter-birth interval of humans is nearly half that of our ape relatives. Another measure is the wide geographical distribution of humans compared with other apes, based on subsistence systems adapted to fine-scale spatial environmental variation. An important macro-evolutionary question is why our big-brained, culture-intensive life-history strategy evolved so recently and in only our lineage. We suggest that increasing spatial and temporal variation in the Pleistocene favoured cultural adaptations.This article is part of the theme issue `Life history and learning: how childhood, caregiving and old age shape cognition and culture in humans and other animals'.},

  abstract = {It is now well established that an individual's experience in the womb can have long-term consequences for their health and well-being. From an evolutionary perspective, it can be predicted that organisms will respond to their early conditions adaptively, maximising their prospects for survival and reproductive prospects under the circumstances. However, relatively little attention is given to the fact that there are multiple ways by which such `developmental plasticity' may evolve. It is necessary to consider kinds of plasticity that can involve something other than an individual organism adapting to an external physical environment. Notably, adaptive developmental plasticity occurs between traits within an individual's body, as well as between individuals (e.g. between mother and foetus). Taking such an inclusive perspective on the nature of developmental plasticity suggests alternative conclusions to the interpretation of patterns of health and disease, and to which kinds of intervention might be expected to be effective.},

  abstract = {Biologists and anthropologists have extensively documented how many animals\textemdash human and non-human\textemdash modify their immediate surroundings, some subtly, others extensively. This trend is carried to its extreme in Homo sapiens to the point where many of us today live in the almost entirely constructed niches of the built urban environment. Proponents of niche construction theory (NCT) argue that classical evolutionary theory does not account satisfactorily for organisms' active niche modification that impacts selective parameters for themselves and/or also other organisms. Complementing evolutionary theory focused on genetic change alone as well as gene-culture co-evolutionary models, NCT aims at integrating ecology, anthropology and evolution by a greater awareness to ecological inheritances. The key to the niche construction approach therefore is the inclusion of organism-induced environmental modification bequeathed from the modifying generation to its offspring. Critically then, it is either selection that leads to changes over time in a given population, or individuals induce changes in their environment in order to offset or channel further selection. While there is intense debate about the merits of NCT within the biosciences, archaeology is in a situation to make an important contribution here: it allows for a greater role of organismal agency in the evolutionary process, and many objects as well as features in the archaeological record speak directly about lasting modifications of the environment. In this chapter, I aim to provide a richly but by no means exhaustively referenced review of the early emergence and development of NCT as well as the controversies surrounding it. I illustrate the specific application of NCT in anthropology and archaeology by focusing on selected behaviours of premodern and modern humans and their co-evolutionary impacts such as the use of fire, changing human-animal and human-plant relations and landscape modifications. I also highlight more subtle forms of niche construction that may have left traces in the cognitive make-up of past and indeed present populations and link NCT with the notion of the Anthropocene. NCT remains a contested body of theory. In concluding, I point to potential archaeological research avenues that can make significant contributions to this emerging field.},

I conceptualize a population as consisting of sub-populations that contain different types of information sources that hold a number of codes. Theoretical saturation is reached after all the codes in the population have been observed once in the sample. I delineate three different scenarios to sample information sources: ``random chance,'' which is based on probability sampling, ``minimal information,'' which yields at least one new code per sampling step, and ``maximum information,'' which yields the largest number of new codes per sampling step. Next, I use simulations to assess the minimum sample size for each scenario for systematically varying hypothetical populations. I show that theoretical saturation is more dependent on the mean probability of observing codes than on the number of codes in a population. Moreover, the minimal and maximal information scenarios are significantly more efficient than random chance, but yield fewer repetitions per code to validate the findings. I formulate guidelines for purposive sampling and recommend that researchers follow a minimum information scenario.},

It does this by contrasting the sexual purity politics of the Vice Society and the medicalization of morality as `moral insanity'. Early in the century the Vice Society promoted coercive legislation with the aim of `suppressing vice'. From mid-century, moral insanity theories sought to grapple with vice by disaggregating `moral' from other forms of insanity. These two movements had quite distinct and incompatible lines of development; and they never overtly engaged with each other. The article makes its key argument by demonstrating the way in which such dissimilar trajectories came together towards the end of the century in the `moral hygiene' movement, mobilizing discourses of `degeneration' (and `feeblemindedness') with projects promoting sexual purity.},

  abstract = {Substantial resources are being devoted to identify candidate genes for complex mental and behavioral disorders through inclusion of environmental exposures following the report of an interaction between the serotonin transporter linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) and stressful life events on an increased risk of major depression.To conduct a meta-analysis of the interaction between the serotonin transporter gene and stressful life events on depression using both published data and individual-level original data.Search of PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases through March 2009 yielded 26 studies of which 14 met criteria for the meta-analysis.Criteria for studies for the meta-analyses included published data on the association between 5-HTTLPR genotype (SS, SL, or LL), number of stressful life events (0, 1, 2, {$\geq$}3) or equivalent, and a categorical measure of depression defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) or the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) or use of a cut point to define depression from standardized rating scales. To maximize our ability to use a common framework for variable definition, we also requested original data from all studies published prior to 2008 that met inclusion criteria. Of the 14 studies included in the meta-analysis, 10 were also included in a second sex-specific meta-analysis of original individual-level data.Logistic regression was used to estimate the effects of the number of short alleles at 5-HTTLPR, the number of stressful life events, and their interaction on depression. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated separately for each study and then weighted averages of the individual estimates were obtained using random-effects meta-analysis. Both sex-combined and sex-specific meta-analyses were conducted. Of a total of 14~250 participants, 1769 were classified as having depression; 12~481 as not having depression.In the meta-analysis of published data, the number of stressful life events was significantly associated with depression (OR, 1.41; 95\% CI,1.25-1.57). No association was found between 5-HTTLPR genotype and depression in any of the individual studies nor in the weighted average (OR, 1.05; 95\% CI, 0.98-1.13) and no interaction effect between genotype and stressful life events on depression was observed (OR, 1.01; 95\% CI, 0.94-1.10). Comparable results were found in the sex-specific meta-analysis of individual-level data.This meta-analysis yielded no evidence that the serotonin transporter genotype alone or in interaction with stressful life events is associated with an elevated risk of depression in men alone, women alone, or in both sexes combined.},

Although it is well established that altruism can be favoured when recipients are relatives or when they reciprocate, it is increasingly being recognized that many behaviours cannot be explained in these terms. Here, I argue that many cases of apparent altruism can be explained by interdependence. I formalize the degree of interdependence by defining an individual's `stake' in another as the dependence of its fitness on that of the other. This provides a means of valuing others, analogous to Hamilton's valuation of relatives. It also provides a conceptual synthesis of theories of altruism, in which kinship and reciprocity become special cases. Interdependence means that cooperators can benefit as a secondary consequence of helping their recipients. Altruism can then be favoured when its costs are outweighed by the altruist's stake in the recipient's benefits. Whereas the exploitation problem makes reciprocal altruism inherently unstable, cooperation through interdependence can be stable because whatever others do, it is best to cooperate. I discuss the extent to which interdependence can explain examples of cooperation that cannot be explained in terms of kinship and reciprocity.},

However, prior studies have focused primarily on explaining variation in Extraversion and Emotionality/Neuroticism as broadband traits. The current study synthesizes data from three subject samples (N = 766) to test correlations of physical strength and attractiveness with the HEXACO factors and facets among young adults. Our analyses reveal specific, functionally meaningful, patterns of phenotypic coordination, and thereby help illuminate which facets drive previously documented associations at the factor-level. Among both sexes, strength was an especially important predictor of facets whose secondary loadings place them in the quadrant of factor space defined by high Extraversion (Expressiveness, Liveliness, Social Boldness) and low Emotionality (Fearfulness, Anxiety). Findings bolster the hypothesis that specific personality strategies are coordinated with phenotypic components of bargaining power, and suggest that granular measures of personality (such as facets) may provide more mechanistic and functional insight than broadband trait factors.},

A universal urine collection method providing representative urinalyses results is needed. The objective of this study is to evaluate the applicability of the currently used urine collection pads (gauze compresses) and a new urine collection device (Peespot). Design and methods: We tested the reliability of routine (semi-)quantitative urinalysis results with these two different kinds of urine collection methods in a laboratory model. Although important in clinical diagnosis, we did not evaluate the effects on cellular and other components such as casts in the urinary sediment. Results: Most semi-quantitative variables determined by urine stick (pH, blood, protein, leukocytes, nitrite, glucose, ketones, bilirubin and urobilinogen) gave concordant results for both methods compared with native urine. Using the Peespot urine collection device, reliable quantitative results were obtained for calcium, chloride, glucose, magnesium, phosphate, potassium, sodium, osmolality, urea nitrogen and urate compared with native urine. Data were concordant only for chloride, phosphate, glucose, sodium and urea nitrogen by use of gauze compresses. Conclusions: Urine collection pads are non-invasive methods useful in the collection of urine in non-toilettrained children. Because of better practical standardisation and more reliable (semi-) quantitative urinalysis results, the Peespot urine collection device is preferred for the collection of urine.},

This calls for a framework to understand how such differences may come to be implemented in brains and neurons. Based on strands of research in social anthropology, we argue that human practices are characterized by particular patterns, and that participating in these patterns orders how people perceive and act in particular group- and context-specific ways. This then leads to a particular patterning of neuronal processes that may be detected using e. g. brain imaging methods. We illustrate this through (a) a classical example of phoneme perception (b) recent work on performance in experimental game play. We then discuss these findings in the light of predictive models of brain function. We argue that a `culture as patterned practices' approach obviates a rigid nature-culture distinction, avoids the problems involved in conceptualizing `culture' as a homogenous grouping variable, and suggests that participating as a competent participant in particular practices may affect both the subjective (first person) experience and (third person) objective measures of behavior and brain activity.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a model for evolutionary origins of unipolar depressive disorders and reviews empirical evidence in support of the ``nonparticipation hypothesis of depression'' suggested by the model. In line with previous theory, depression is interpreted to provide means for not participating in joint enterprises that would otherwise be difficult to avoid (`bargaining' model); therefore, it provides an additional alternative strategy to social-imitation dynamics occurring in Public Good Games. Average income from joint enterprises modeled with a Public Good Game is interpreted to drive group-level genetic selection. Based on these assumptions, it is shown that if a joint enterprise is sufficiently important for both the between-individual and the between-groups competition, then a nonparticipation strategy (or gene for depression vulnerability) will be present in total population almost surely (i.e., with probability one). The modeling framework serves to explain several other seemingly unrelated empirical observations, such as association between income inequality and depression, co-morbidity and proximal biological mechanisms for negative emotions, and mechanisms for the social networkdynamics of emotion.},

  abstract = {An external or internal ``predictive adaptive response'' (PAR) can be defined as an adaptive change in long-term behavior or development due to an environmental exposure that triggers it. A PAR can lead to differential development among initially similar individuals, and increase evolutionary fitness. Despite many theories and empirical observations of PAR-like changes in depressive tendencies, clear empirical findings on human personality changes following depressive symptoms are lacking, possibly because these changes take a long time to develop and most follow up studies have been short. Here we show that in sufficiently long (5- and 15-year) clinical and general-population follow ups, increases can be observed in the Temperament and Character Inventory's personality trait harm avoidance as a function of temporally accumulating major depressive episodes (132 depression patients from Vantaa Depression Study) and depressive symptoms (3105 participants from Young Finns general-population sample). Personality changes did not occur in the other six personality traits of the inventory, but did in a highly similar neuroticism trait from another inventory. Even when controlling for concurrent changes in depressive symptoms from the baseline to the endpoint, depressive symptoms that occurred during the follow-up period associated with harm-avoidance changes, rendering individuals more fearful and anticipating harm. This study provides consistent, specific, and plausible dose\textendash response and temporal gradients between accumulated depressive episodes and personality change. Effect sizes were between small to moderate, though. Altogether, the findings support the feasibility of using existing systems of personality assessment (i.e., self-report questionnaires) to study PARs, despite the multiplicity of the systems.},

  abstract = {Divorce is associated with an increased probability of a depressive episode, but the causation of events remains unclear. Adaptive models of depression propose that depression is a social strategy in part, whereas non-adaptive models tend to propose a diathesis-stress mechanism. We compare an adaptive evolutionary model of depression to three alternative non-adaptive models with respect to their ability to explain the temporal pattern of depression around the time of divorce. Register-based data (304,112 individuals drawn from a random sample of 11\% of Finnish people) on antidepressant purchases is used as a proxy for depression. This proxy affords an unprecedented temporal resolution (a 3-monthly prevalence estimates over 10 years) without any bias from non-compliance, and it can be linked with underlying episodes via a statistical model. The evolutionary-adaptation model (all time periods with risk of divorce are depressogenic) was the best quantitative description of the data. The non-adaptive stress-relief model (period before divorce is depressogenic and period afterwards is not) provided the second best quantitative description of the data. The peak-stress model (periods before and after divorce can be depressogenic) fit the data less well, and the stress-induction model (period following divorce is depressogenic and the preceding period is not) did not fit the data at all. The evolutionary model was the most detailed mechanistic description of the divorce-depression link among the models, and the best fit in terms of predicted curvature; thus, it offers most rigorous hypotheses for further study. The stress-relief model also fit very well and was the best model in a sensitivity analysis, encouraging development of more mechanistic models for that hypothesis.},

The analysis has been replicated cross\textendash nationally, and the results have been reasonably robust. However, these findings do not necessarily imply discontinuities or non\textendash linearities in the Big Five data. We study whether the RUO types can arise from typical Big Five intercorrelations alone. We used data from a previous meta\textendash analysis of inter\textendash trait correlations (N = 144 117 participants) and simulated normally distributed observations with this correlation structure. Applying three different clustering algorithms (k\textendash means, hierarchical agglomerative, and model based) with three\textendash cluster solutions to the simulated data, we examined whether the known correlations alone can give rise to the RUO typology. The simulated results were compared with previous empirical findings. A simple multivariate normal distribution with the Big Five correlation structure was sufficient to generate the RUO typology in three\textendash cluster solutions for all the three clustering methods. Contrary to the RUO typology `carving personality description at its joints', linear correlations typical for correlations among Big Five traits can create RUO types even in the absence of any points of discontinuity.

  abstract = {Darwin's theory of sexual selection fundamentally changed how we think about sex and evolution. The struggle over mating and fertilization is a powerful driver of diversification within and among species. Contemporaries dismissed Darwin's conjecture of a ``taste for the beautiful'' as favoring particular mates over others, but there is now overwhelming evidence for a primary role of both male and female mate choice in sexual selection. Darwin's misogyny precluded much analysis of the ``taste''; an increasing focus on mate choice mechanisms before, during, and after mating reveals that these often evolve in response to selection pressures that have little to do with sexual selection on chosen traits. Where traits and preferences do coevolve, they can do so whether fitness effects on choosers are positive, neutral, or negative. The spectrum of selection on traits and preferences, and how traits and preferences respond to social effects, determine how sexual selection and mate choice influence broader-scale processes like reproductive isolation and population responses to environmental change.           ,              The power of choice                            In his book               The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex               , Darwin proposed the concept of sexual selection, specifically that the vagaries of choice during reproduction could also shape patterns of adaptation\textemdash and thus evolution. Despite this groundbreaking thinking, his Victorian ideas about women affected his ability to see just how influential mate choice, especially from the female side, could be. Rosenthal and Ryan review progress that has been made in this area in the 150 years since Darwin first proposed sexual selection, paying special attention to how more equitable thinking has led to significant scientific advances in our understanding. \textemdash SNV                        ,              A review suggests that Darwin's theory of sexual selection is being illuminated by a recent focus on mate-choice mechanisms.           ,                             BACKGROUND                                Charles Darwin's~                 Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex~                 tackled the two main controversies arising from the                 Origin of Species:~                 the evolution of humans from animal ancestors and the evolution of sexual ornaments. Most of the book focuses on the latter, Darwin's theory of sexual selection. Research since supports his conjecture that songs, perfumes, and intricate dances evolve because they help secure mating partners. Evidence is overwhelming for a primary role of both male and female mate choice in sexual selection\textemdash not only through premating courtship but also through intimate interactions during and long after mating.                              But what makes one prospective mate more enticing than another? Darwin, shaped by misogyny and sexual prudery, invoked a ``taste for the beautiful'' without speculating on the origin of the ``taste.'' How to explain when the ``final marriage ceremony'' is between two rams? What of oral sex in bats, cloacal rubbing in bonobos, or the sexual spectrum in humans, all observable in Darwin's time? By explaining desire through the lens of those male traits that caught his eyes and those of his gender and culture, Darwin elided these data in his theory of sexual evolution.               Work since Darwin has focused on how traits and preferences coevolve. Preferences can evolve even if attractive signals only predict offspring attractiveness, but most attention has gone to the intuitive but tenuous premise that mating with gorgeous partners yields vigorous offspring.               By focusing on those aspects of mating preferences that coevolve with male traits, many of Darwin's influential followers have followed the same narrow path. The sexual selection debate in the 1980s was framed as ``good genes versus runaway'': Do preferences coevolve with traits because traits predict genetic benefits, or simply because they are beautiful? To the broader world this is still the conversation.                                         ADVANCES               Even as they evolve toward ever-more-beautiful signals and healthier offspring, mate-choice mechanisms and courter traits are locked in an arms race of coercion and resistance, persuasion and skepticism. Traits favored by sexual selection often do so at the expense of chooser fitness, creating sexual conflict. Choosers then evolve preferences in response to the costs imposed by courters.               Often, though, the current traits of courters tell us little about how preferences arise. Sensory systems are often tuned to nonsexual cues like food, favoring mating signals resembling those cues. And preferences can emerge simply from selection on choosing conspecifics. Sexual selection can therefore arise from chooser biases that have nothing to do with ornaments.               Choice may occur before mating, as Darwin emphasized, but individuals mate multiple times and bias fertilization and offspring care toward favored partners. Mate choice can thus occur in myriad ways after mating, through behavioral, morphological, and physiological mechanisms.               Like other biological traits, mating preferences vary among individuals and species along multiple dimensions. Some of this is likely adaptive, as different individuals will have different optimal mates. Indeed, mate choice may be more about choosing compatible partners than picking the ``best'' mate in the absolute sense. Compatibility-based choice can drive or reinforce genetic divergence and lead to speciation.               The mechanisms underlying the ``taste for the beautiful'' determine whether mate choice accelerates or inhibits reproductive isolation. If preferences are learned from parents, or covary with ecological differences like the sensory environment, then choice can promote genetic divergence. If everyone shares preferences for attractive ornaments, then choice promotes gene flow between lineages.                                         OUTLOOK               Two major trends continue to shift the emphasis away from male ``beauty'' and toward how and why individuals make sexual choices. The first integrates neuroscience, genomics, and physiology. We need not limit ourselves to the feathers and dances that dazzled Darwin, which gives us a vastly richer picture of mate choice. The second is that despite persistent structural inequities in academia, a broader range of people study a broader range of questions.               This new focus confirms Darwin's insight that mate choice makes a primary contribution to sexual selection, but suggests that sexual selection is often tangential to mate choice. This conclusion challenges a persistent belief with sinister roots, whereby mate choice is all about male ornaments. Under this view, females evolve to prefer handsome males who provide healthy offspring, or alternatively, to express flighty whims for arbitrary traits. But mate-choice mechanisms also evolve for a host of other reasons               Understanding mate choice mechanisms is key to understanding how sexual decisions underlie speciation and adaptation to environmental change. New theory and technology allow us to explicitly connect decision-making mechanisms with their evolutionary consequences. A century and a half after Darwin, we can shift our focus to females and males as choosers, rather than the gaudy by-products of mate choice.

Evidence suggests that stress during pregnancy is associated with inflammation during pregnancy, consistent with risk for preterm birth. However, research has not tested whether complementary changes are reflected in immune cell gene expression, or upstream regulation of inflammation. The purpose of this study was to test associations between preconception and prenatal stress exposure and third trimester immune cell gene expression, focusing specifically on sets of genes previously linked to stress in non-pregnant samples: Pro-inflammatory genes, and antiviral and antibody genes. Methods. A sample of 116 low-income, diverse women was recruited from 5 U.S. sites by the Community Child and Health Network at the birth of a child. This study is of the subgroup of women who became pregnant again over the two-year follow-up period, and provided information on stressful life events that occurred both preconception and during the third trimester of the subsequent pregnancy. Dried blood spots (DBS) were collected in the third trimester of pregnancy, and used for gene expression analysis. Results. Women with more prenatal stressful life events had higher expression of pro-inflammatory genes when compared to those with fewer life events, and the effect was driven by increased activation of pro-inflammatory transcription factors, NF-{$\kappa$}B and AP-1. Preconception stressful life event exposure was not associated with gene expression profiles. When entered into models simultaneously, only prenatal stressful life events were associated with up-regulation of pro-inflammatory genes. No differences between high or low stress groups emerged for antiviral or antibody genes. Conclusions. Prenatal stress exposure was associated with up-regulated pro-inflammatory gene expression during pregnancy, and increased activity of NF-{$\kappa$}B and AP-1. In contrast, stress occurring preconception was not associated with gene expression. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that stress-induced activation of pro-inflammatory transcriptional pathways in pregnancy, but not earlier, may increase risk for inflammation-driven adverse pregnancy outcomes.},

A N170 was obtained for all categories of stimuli, including Greebles. However, only inverted faces delayed and enhanced N170 (bilaterally). These observations indicate that the N170 is not specific to faces, as has been previously claimed. In addition, the amplitude difference between faces and objects does not reflect face-specific mechanisms since it can be smaller than between non-face object categories. There do exist some early differences in the time-course of categorization for faces and non- faces across inversion. This may be attributed either to stimulus category per se (e.g. face-specific mechanisms) or to differences in the level of expertise between these categories.}

Retention was over 87\% at 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month assessments. Results The majority of medical, psychiatric, substance use, and service utilization characteristic comparisons were not significant. However, medical marijuana users had significantly more medical problems, a significantly larger proportion reported {$>$}15 days medical problems in the past month, and significantly smaller proportions reported no pain and no mobility limitations (p?}

Thirty-one adults with ADHD and stable psychopharmacology for ADHD were randomized to CBT plus continued psychopharmacology or continued psychopharmacology alone. Assessments included ADHD severity and associated anxiety and depression rated by an independent evaluator (IE) and by self-report. At the outcome assessment, those who were randomized to CBT had lower IE-rated ADHD symptoms (p{$<$}.01) and global severity (p{$<$}.002), as well as self-reported ADHD symptoms (p{$<$}.0001) than those randomized to continued psychopharmacology alone. Those in the CBT group also had lower IE-rated and self-report anxiety (p's{$<$}.04), lower IE-rated depression (p{$<$}.01), and a trend to have lower self-reported depression (p=.06). CBT continued to show superiority over continued psychopharmacology alone when statistically controlling levels of depression in analyses of core ADHD symptoms. There were significantly more treatment responders among patients who received CBT (56\%) compared to those who did not (13\%) (p{$<$}.02). These data support the hypothesis that CBT for adults with ADHD with residual symptoms is a feasible, acceptable, and potentially efficacious next-step treatment approach, worthy of further testing.},

  abstract = {Abstract             High-fidelity transmission of information through imitation and teaching has been proposed as necessary for cumulative cultural evolution. Yet, it is unclear when and for which knowledge domains children employ different social learning processes. This paper explores the development of social learning processes and play in BaYaka hunter-gatherer children by analysing video recordings and time budgets of children from early infancy to adolescence. From infancy to early childhood, hunter-gatherer children learn mainly by imitating and observing others' activities. From early childhood, learning occurs mainly in playgroups and through practice. Throughout childhood boys engage in play more often than girls whereas girls start foraging wild plants from early childhood and spend more time in domestic activities and childcare. Sex differences in play reflect the emergence of sexual division of labour and the play-work transition occurring earlier for girls. Consistent with theoretical models, teaching occurs for skills/knowledge that cannot be transmitted with high fidelity through other social learning processes such as the acquisition of abstract information e.g. social norms. Whereas, observational and imitative learning occur for the transmission of visually transparent skills such as tool use, foraging, and cooking. These results suggest that coevolutionary relationships between human sociality, language and teaching have likely been fundamental in the emergence of human cumulative culture.},

Methods: This study was a cross-sectional survey administered in 2017 through Amazon's Mechanical Turk and enrolled 432 adult, regular cannabis users. Measures included demographics, cannabis use characteristics, and medical reasons for cannabis use. Results: Under half (47\%) of respondents endorsed using cannabis for both medical and recreational reasons and 12\% reported medical use only. The most commonly cited reasons for medical cannabis use were psychiatric and 60 unique medical conditions were listed. Recreational and medical users were similar on several measures of current use, but did vary in their use history, methods of use, and product knowledge. Conclusions: Despite state laws and conclusive scientific evidence to support medical cannabis use for certain conditions, cannabis is still used frequently for a range of medical issues. Policy Implications: These data may assist healthcare providers in better understanding medical cannabis use in states with tightened restrictions and tailoring information to medical cannabis users about their specific conditions and prioritizing therapeutic options.},

Similarly, non-human animals maintain differentiated social relationships that promote dyadic cooperative exchange, but their link to cooperative collective action is little known. Here, we investigate the influence of social relationship properties on male and female chimpanzee participations in a costly form of group action, intergroup encounters. We find that intergroup encounter participation increases with a greater number of other participants as well as when participants are maternal kin or social bond partners, and that these effects are independent from one another and from the likelihood to associate with certain partners. Together, strong social relationships between kin and non-kin facilitate group-level cooperation in one of our closest living relatives, suggesting that social bonds may be integral to the evolution of cooperation in our own species.},

As evidence, I make two additions to the signaling model: a cost for more complex signaling strategies and the ability to combine information in signals with independent information. Analysis and simulation of the altered model shows that it leads to the predicted outcome of evolution favoring ambiguous signaling.},

Thus, critically, the troop's unique culture was being adopted by new males joining the troop.

A recent case in which a distinctive social tradition of low aggression and high affiliation was established in a troop of wild baboons appears to represent an instance of social culture in that the social style has been transmitted across generations for nearly two decades.

Paternal testosterone may reflect fathers' investment in pair-bonding and paternal caregiving and, as such, may be associated with maternal and familial well-being. This study tests associations between paternal testosterone, paternal and maternal postpartum depressive symptoms, and subsequent family functioning. Within 149 couples, fathers provided testosterone samples when infants were approximately nine months old and both parents reported on postpartum depressive symptoms at two, nine, and 15months postpartum. Fathers with lower aggregate testosterone reported more depressive symptoms at two and nine months postpartum. Mothers whose partners had higher evening testosterone reported more depressive symptoms at nine and 15months postpartum. Maternal relationship satisfaction mediated this effect, such that mothers with higher testosterone partners reported more relationship dissatisfaction, which in turn predicted more maternal depressive symptoms. Higher paternal testosterone and paternal depressive symptoms at nine months postpartum each independently predicted greater fathering stress at 15months postpartum. Higher paternal testosterone also predicted more mother-reported intimate partner aggression at 15months postpartum. In addition to linear relationships between testosterone and depression, curvilinear relationships emerged such that fathers with both low and high testosterone at nine months postpartum reported more subsequent (15-month) depressive symptoms and fathering stress. In conclusion, whereas higher paternal testosterone may protect against paternal depression, it contributed to maternal distress and suboptimal family outcomes in our sample. Interventions that supplement or alter men's testosterone may have unintended consequences for family well-being.},

Previous studies have investigated these contributions across a broad time period, from infancy through toddlerhood. Here, we extend and refine the grandmothering literature to investigate the perinatal period as a critical window for grandmaternal contributions. We propose that mother-daughter co-residence during this period affords targeted grandmaternal effort during a period of heightened vulnerability and appreciable impact. We conducted two focus groups and 37 semi-structured interviews with Himba women. Interviews focused on experiences from their first and, if applicable, their most recent birth and included information on social support, domains of teaching and learning, and infant feeding practices. Our qualitative findings reveal three domains in which grandmothers contribute: learning to mother, breastfeeding support, and postnatal health and well-being. We show that informational, emotional, and instrumental support provided to new mothers and their neonates during the perinatal period can aid in the establishment of the mother-infant bond, buffer maternal energy balance, and improve nutritional outcomes for infants. These findings demonstrate that the role of grandmother can be crucial, even when alloparenting is common and breastfeeding is frequent and highly visible. Situated within the broader anthropological and clinical literature, these findings substantiate the claim that humans have evolved in an adaptive sociocultural perinatal complex in which grandmothers provide significant contributions to the health and well-being of their reproductive-age daughters and grandchildren.},

The chronology and physical diversity of Pleistocene human fossils suggest that morphologically varied populations pertaining to the H. sapiens clade lived throughout Africa. Similarly, the African archaeological record demonstrates the polycentric origin and persistence of regionally distinct Pleistocene material culture in a variety of paleoecological settings. Genetic studies also indicate that present-day population structure within Africa extends to deep times, paralleling a paleoenvironmental record of shifting and fractured habitable zones. We argue that these fields support an emerging view of a highly structured African prehistory that should be considered in human evolutionary inferences, prompting new interpretations, questions, and interdisciplinary research directions.},

  abstract = {,  Success in marriage markets has lasting impacts on women's wellbeing. By arranging marriages, parents exert financial and social powers to influence spouse characteristics and ensure optimal marriages. While arranging marriages is a major focus of parental investment, marriage decisions are also a source of conflict between parents and daughters in which parents often have more power. The process of market integration may alter parental investment strategies, however, increasing children's bargaining power and reducing parents' influence over children's marriage decisions. We use data from a market integrating region of Bangladesh to (a) describe temporal changes in marriage types, (b) identify which women enter arranged marriages and (c) determine how market integration affects patterns of arranged marriage. Most women's marriages were arranged, with love marriages more recent. We found few predictors of who entered arranged vs. love marriages, and family-level market integration did not predict marriage type at the individual level. However, based on descriptive findings, and findings relating women's and fathers' education to groom characteristics, we argue that at the society-level market integration has opened a novel path in which daughters use their own status, gained via parental investments, to facilitate good marriages under conditions of reduced parental assistance or control.},

This paper analyzes the concept of replication from a theoretical point of view. It demonstrates that the theoretical demands are scarcely met in everyday work within the social sciences. Some demands are just not feasible, whereas others are constricted by restrictions relating to publication. A new classification scheme based on a functional approach that distinguishes between different types of replication is proposed. Next, it will be argued that replication addresses the important connection between existing and new knowledge. To do so it has to be applied explicitly and systematically. The paper ends with a description of procedures how this could be done and a set of recommendations how to handle the concept of replication in the future to exploit its potential to the full.},

  abstract = {Humans transmit cultural information to others in a variety of ways that can affect productivity, cultural success, and ultimately fitness. Not all potential transmitters are expected to be equally preferred by learners or equally willing to influence their culture acquisition. Across socioeconomic opportunities and ages in the human life course, costs and benefits to both learners and potential transmitters are expected to vary, affecting rates of culture transmission from different vectors. Here we examine reported patterns of culture transmission contributing to 92 essential skills among a sample of 421 Tsimane forager-farmers native to Bolivia. Consistent with the expectation that the costly provision of support and cultural information typically flows from older to younger generations in a subsistence society, we find that the development of essential knowledge and skills is primarily influenced by older same-sex relatives, especially parents. Grandparents are more often reported as transmitters for low-strength/high-difficulty skills that they have comparative advantage in, such as storytelling and musical performance. Though less frequent, same generation peers are more likely to provide discourage\- ment in the learning process and to transmit modern, market-oriented skills. Our findings suggest that kinship, gender, generational seniority, and skill type together explain the vectors and styles of influence responsible for essential culture transmission. The multigenerational pedagogy documented here helps facilitate successful economic and social production in a complex skills niche dependent on multigenerational cooperation, such as observed in human hunter-gatherers and other subsistence populations.},

  abstract = {Our long co-evolutionary history with infectious agents likely began soon after the rise of the first single-celled organisms. This ongoing evolutionary arms race has generated complex host adaptations, many highly conserved, for resisting infection (e.g., innate and acquired immune systems, infection-sensitive developmental programs, sexual reproduction). A large body of evidence suggests that, in humans, pathogen-avoidance disgust is an emotion that motivates avoidance of cues associated with pathogens, thereby reducing infection. However, the question of whether there is an emotion that coordinates resistance to active infection has received less attention. We propose that lassitude is such an emotion. It is triggered by cues of active infection and coordinates the fight against infection by: (a) reducing energetically expensive movement to make more energy available to the immune system, (b) reducing exposure to additional infections and injuries that would compound the immune system's workload, (c) promoting thermoregulatory behaviors that facilitate immunity, (d) regulating food consumption to be beneficial for the host but detrimental to pathogens, and (e) deploying strategies that elicit caregiving behavior from social allies. Lassitude exhibits the core features of an emotion \textendash{} it is triggered by cues of an adaptive problem (i.e., infection), generates a characteristic facial expression (e.g., slack facial muscles, drooping eyelids, slightly parted lips), and has distinct qualia (e.g., profound tiredness, reduced appetite, feelings of vulnerability, altered temperature perception, increased pain sensitivity). We outline the information-processing structure of lassitude, review existing evidence, suggest directions for future research, and discuss implications of lassitude for models of human evolution.},

Accumulating evidence suggests there are some unintended consequences of these explanations, including reduced optimism for recovery among individuals with depression. However, little is known about how these beliefs relate to treatment process and outcomes in a psychiatric treatment setting, a gap this study aimed to fill. Methods: We examined etiological beliefs about depression in a sample of patients (N = 279) seeking acute treatment in a behaviorally-based therapy program at a psychiatric hospital and examined relations with treatment expectations and outcomes. Results: We found that although psychosocial explanations of depression were most popular, biogenetic beliefs, particularly the belief that depression is caused by a chemical imbalance, were prevalent in this sample. Further, the chemical imbalance belief related to poorer treatment expectations. This relationship was moderated by symptoms of depression, with more depressed individuals showing a stronger relationship between chemical imbalance beliefs and lower treatment expectations. Finally, the chemical imbalance belief predicted more depressive symptoms after the treatment program ended for a 2-week measure of depression (but not for a 24hour measure of depression), controlling for psychiatric symptoms at admission, inpatient hospitalizations, and treatment expectations. Limitations: The sample was homogenous in terms of race and ethnicity and we did not assess how patients came to their beliefs. Conclusions: Together, the results illustrate the correlates and possible impacts of etiological beliefs in a realworld clinical setting and invite a critical discussion about predominant messages about the etiology of de\- pression.},

This implies that JOLs should not be used to determine how long or in what manner to study, although they can be used to determine what to study. To counter poor calibration, explicit metamemory knowledge can be learned and applied in order for students to become more efficient learners.

Here, we subject NCT to critical evaluation, in the form of a collaboration between one prominent advocate of NCT, and a team of skeptics. We discuss whether niche construction is an evolutionary process, whether NCT obscures or clarifies how natural selection leads to organismal adaptation, and whether niche construction and natural selection are of equivalent explanatory importance. We also consider whether the literature that promotes NCT overstates the significance of niche construction, whether it is internally coherent, and whether it accurately portrays standard evolutionary theory. Our disagreements reflect a wider dispute within evolutionary theory over whether the neo-Darwinian synthesis is in need of reformulation, as well as different usages of some key terms (e.g., evolutionary process).},

  abstract = {It has been argued that size matters on the human mate market: both stated preferences and mate choices have been found to be non-random with respect to height and weight. But how universal are these patterns? Most of the literature on human mating patterns is based on post-industrial societies. Much less is known about mating behaviour in more traditional societies. Here we investigate mate choice by analysing whether there is any evidence for non-random mating with respect to size and strength in a forager community, the Hadza of Tanzania. We test whether couples assort for height, weight, body mass index (BMI), per cent fat and grip strength. We test whether there is a male-taller norm. Finally, we test for an association between anthropometric variables and number of marriages. Our results show no evidence for assortative mating for height, weight, BMI or per cent fat; no evidence for a male-taller norm and no evidence that number of marriages is associated with our size variables. Hadza couples may assort positively for grip strength, but grip strength does not affect the number of marriages. Overall we conclude that, in contrast to post-industrial societies, mating appears to be random with respect to size in the Hadza.},

  abstract = {Objective(s) We explored the relationship between Intimate Partner Violence (IPV), pregnancy intention and contraceptive use in Honduras. Study design We used the most recent Honduras Demographic and Health Survey (DHS 2011\textendash 2012) data to examine the relationship between physical IPV, sexual IPV and emotional IPV with pregnancy intention; contraceptive use; and husband's knowledge of contraceptive use among a sample of 6629 women. Multiple logistic regression was used to estimate effects of IPV on the outcomes, controlling for empowerment indicators and socio-demographic variables. Results Among currently married women with at least one living child born within the past 5 years, IPV was significantly associated with several outcomes. Women reporting any physical IPV (13.5\%) were less likely to have wanted their last child (aOR: 0.52, p{$<$}.001) or to desire future children (aOR: 0.76, p=.002), and more likely to have ever used contraception (aOR: 2.32 p=.004). Those reporting physical with sexual violence (4.1\%) were less likely to have wanted their last child (aOR: 0.59, p=.016). Women reporting emotional IPV (27.4\%) were less likely to have wanted their last child (aOR: 0.56, p{$<$}.001) or to desire more children (aOR: 0.81, p{$<$}.001) and more likely to have ever used (aOR: 1.78, p{$<$}.001) and currently be using contraception (aOR: 1.19, p=.006). Conclusion(s) IPV was associated with both unwanted pregnancy and increased contraceptive use among married Honduran women. Universal screening for IPV among women who seek SRH services in Honduras may help identify women in need and reduce stigma around IPV while improving SRH outcomes. Implications Honduran women exposed to intimate partner violence (IPV) were more likely to have ever used contraception yet more likely to report an unwanted pregnancy. Universal screening for IPV among women seeking sexual and reproductive health services may help identify women in need and reduce stigma around IPV while improving outcomes.},

Given the documented short- and long-term medical and neurodevelopmental advantages of breastfeeding, infant nutrition should be considered a public health issue and not only a lifestyle choice. The American Academy of Pediatrics reaffirms its recommendation of exclusive breastfeeding for about 6 months, followed by continued breastfeeding as complementary foods are introduced, with continuation of breastfeeding for 1 year or longer as mutually desired by mother and infant. Medical contraindications to breastfeeding are rare. Infant growth should be monitored with the World Health Organization (WHO) Growth Curve Standards to avoid mislabeling infants as underweight or failing to thrive. Hospital routines to encourage and support the initiation and sustaining of exclusive breastfeeding should be based on the American Academy of Pediatrics-endorsed WHO/UNICEF ``Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding.'' National strategies supported by the US Surgeon General's Call to Action, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and The Joint Commission are involved to facilitate breastfeeding practices in US hospitals and communities. Pediatricians play a critical role in their practices and communities as advocates of breastfeeding and thus should be knowledgeable about the health risks of not breastfeeding, the economic benefits to society of breastfeeding, and the techniques for managing and supporting the breastfeeding dyad. The ``Business Case for Breastfeeding'' details how mothers can maintain lactation in the workplace and the benefits to employers who facilitate this practice.},

  abstract = {The genetic adaptation of humans to the consumption of milk from dairying animals is one of the most emblematic cases of recent human evolution. While the phenotypic change under selection, lactase persistence (LP), is known, the evolutionary advantage conferred to persistent individuals remains obscure. One informative but underappreciated observation is that not all populations whose ancestors had access to milk genetically adapted to become lactase persistent. Indeed, Central Asian herders are mostly lactase nonpersistent, despite their significant dietary reliance on dairy products. Investigating the temporal dynamic of the -13.910:C{$>$}T Eurasian mutation associated with LP, we found that, after its emergence in Ukraine 5,960 before present (BP), the T allele spread between 4,000 BP and 3,500 BP throughout Eurasia, from Spain to Kazakhstan. The timing and geographical progression of the mutation coincides well with the migration of steppe populations across and outside of Europe. After 3,000 BP, the mutation strongly increased in frequency in Europe, but not in Asia. We propose that Central Asian herders have adapted to milk consumption culturally, by fermentation, and/or by colonic adaptation, rather than genetically. Given the possibility of a nongenetic adaptation to avoid intestinal symptoms when consuming dairy products, the puzzle then becomes this: why has LP been selected for at all?},

Because it is probable that the voice contains cues of strength and formidability that are not available visually, we predicted that selection has also equipped humans with the ability to estimate physical strength from the voice. We found that subjects accurately assessed upper-body strength in voices taken from eight samples across four distinct populations and language groups: the Tsimane of Bolivia, Andean herder-horticulturalists and United States and Romanian college students. Regardless of whether raters were told to assess height, weight, strength or fighting ability, they produced similar ratings that tracked upper-body strength independent of height and weight. Male voices were more accurately assessed than female voices, which is consistent with ethnographic data showing a greater tendency among males to engage in violent aggression. Raters extracted information about strength from the voice that was not supplied from visual cues, and were accurate with both familiar and unfamiliar languages. These results provide, to our knowledge, the first direct evidence that both men and women can accurately assess men's physical strength from the voice, and suggest that estimates of strength are used to assess fighting ability.},

Multiple lines of evidence from archaeology, criminology, anthropology, physiology, and psychology suggest that fighting ability was a crucial aspect of intrasexual competition for ancestral human males, and this has contributed to the evolution of numerous physical and psychological sex differences. Because fighting ability was relevant to many domains of interaction, male psychology should have evolved such that a man's attitudes and behavioral responses are calibrated according to his formidability. Data are reviewed showing that better fighters feel entitled to better outcomes, set lower thresholds for anger/aggression, have self-favoring political attitudes, and believe more in the utility of warfare. New data are presented showing that among Hollywood actors, those selected for their physical strength (i.e., action stars) are more likely to believe in the utility of warfare.},

Bargaining power comes from multiple sources including formidability (e.g. personal fighting ability) and cooperative value (e.g. mate value). Here, we apply this basic conceptual framework to human adolescents and test seven core hypotheses derived from this paradigm on a large sample of Swiss students (N=1447; 15\textendash 17years old). Three components of bargaining power were measured in males and females: fighting ability, coalitional strength, and mate value. Fighting ability and mate value reliably predicted aggression, aggressive attitudes, and delinquent behavior in both boys and girls. The effect of fighting ability on aggression was predictably larger and more robust in males than females. Coalitional strength also reliably predicted aggressive bargaining in boys but less consistently in girls. Regression analyses showed that the effect of each component of bargaining power was independent and survived numerous controls. Results support the thesis that individual differences in aggressive behavior result, in part, from individual differences in bargaining power.},

  abstract = {According to the recalibrational theory of anger, anger is a computationally complex cognitive system that evolved to bargain for better treatment. Anger coordinates facial expressions, vocal changes, verbal arguments, the withholding of benefits, the deployment of aggression, and a suite of other cognitive and physiological variables in the service of leveraging bargaining position into better outcomes. The prototypical trigger of anger is an indication that the offender places too little weight on the angry individual's welfare when making decisions, i.e. the offender has too low a welfare tradeoff ratio (WTR) toward the angry individual. Twenty-three experiments in six cultures, including a group of foragers in the Ecuadorian Amazon, tested six predictions about the computational structure of anger derived from the recalibrational theory. Subjects judged that anger would intensify when: (i) the cost was large, (ii) the benefit the offender received from imposing the cost was small, or (iii) the offender imposed the cost despite knowing that the angered individual was the person to be harmed. Additionally, anger-based arguments conformed to a conceptual grammar of anger, such that offenders were inclined to argue that they held a high WTR toward the victim, e.g., ``the cost I imposed on you was small'', ``the benefit I gained was large'', or ``I didn't know it was you I was harming.'' These results replicated across all six tested cultures: the US, Australia, Turkey, Romania, India, and Shuar hunter-horticulturalists in Ecuador. Results contradict key predictions about anger based on equity theory and social constructivism.},

According to this approach, anger evolved by natural selection to bargain for better treatment. Thus, the major triggers of anger (e.g. cost impositions, cues of disrespect) all indicate an increased willingness (on the part of the offender) to impose costs on the angry individual. Once triggered, the anger system bargains using the two primary incentives that humans have available to modify others' behavior in favor of the focal individual: the imposition of costs and the denial of benefits. This simple functional sketch of anger is then supplemented with additional considerations needed to address the resultant selection pressures created by bargaining. This process offers functionally sound and theoretically justified explanations for: anger in aggressive and cooperative contexts, the role of apologies and their sincerity, the content of sex-specific insults, the computational structure of ``intentionality'' in the context of anger, and the origin of the implicit rules of combat.},

It has only been within the last few centuries that a significant number of the world's children must learn some culturally important context-independent skills, such as reading, writing, and mathematics. These skills are usually taught to children by unfamiliar adults in unfamiliar settings. The result is that much of formal education is an evolutionary novelty. Sitting in classrooms, reading books, or memorizing multiplication tables were certainly not requisite skills for our evolutionary forechildren to master. Yet such evolutionarily novel tasks are critical for functioning in modern societies, and children are quite capable of achieving such feats given appropriate attention and training. However, this leaves many contemporary societies with discrepancies between conditions of modern life and the evolutionary skill set endowed to each child by human cognitive evolution. It is the job of education to bridge this gap, and just as an evolutionary perspective can inform the study of child development at large, perhaps it can also inform educational practices. This chapter presents a brief summary of current common education practice and theory, followed by a description of theory and research underlying an evolutionary approach to education in an effort to prompt discussion regarding the merits and applicability of evolutionary reasoning to education.},

One set of hypotheses points to a market that has evolved from foreign to domestic sources of supply, and to continuing advances in sophisticated cultivation techniques. Another set of hypotheses points to testing artifacts related to changes in the sampling, handling, and testing of illicit marijuana. The current study uses data from the federally sponsored Potency Monitoring Program, which performs ongoing forensic analysis of seized marijuana samples, to assess the extent to which the observed increase in cannabis potency in the USA between 1970 and 2010 is a function of genuine shifts in illicit marijuana markets or testing artifacts related to changes in the quality of seized marijuana. The study finds, after adjusting for marijuana quality, that the apparent 10.5 factor increase in mean reported THC\% between the 1970s and the 2000s is instead on the order of a six- to seven-fold increase. By this accounting, then, the reported long-term rise in potency is roughly 57\textendash 67\% as great when the quality of the tested marijuana is taken into account. This study's findings, therefore, caution against the uncritical use of potency monitoring data and highlight the importance of assessing potency measurement reliability and addressing data quality issues in future policy analytic research.

  abstract = {The most consistent finding across all of the studies on the prevalence and incidence of unipolar major depression is that it is approximately twofold more common among women than men. Although, during the last century psychoanalysis and psychodynamic psychology had founded a lot of theories with respect to psychopathology, it should be accentuated that still no hypothetical points have been supported by methodical research. Evolutionary psychology and psychiatry is based on Darwin's theory regarding evolution and sexual selection is a subtype of natural selection in which individuals compete for mates. While brains result in activities that maximize inclusive fitness, reproductive effort is to get mates, and to take care of offspring. Negative emotions exist only because they have been useful\ldots{} for human genes, even if not always for human individuals. So, determining if an emotional response is atypical necessitates knowing the circumstances it has been shaped to cope with, and whether or not that state is present. While low mood is aroused when efforts to reach a goal are proving futile, continued pursuit of an unapproachable aim can escalate low mood into clinical depression. Though evolutionary psychology and psychiatry has supposed, so far, some specific mechanisms as regards the genesis of depression in human being, according to an innovative explanation depression may result from a ``passive'' ongoing struggle for attainment of a favorite mate, which may foster the mentality for engagement of proximate mechanisms for generation of depression; a phenomenon similar to learned helplessness. The present article reviews the involving elements and mechanisms of the said formulation and considers a practical solution, incidentally.},

  abstract = {Progesterone (P4) is an important steroid hormone for the establishment and maintenance of pregnancy and its functional withdrawal in reproductive tissue is linked with the onset of parturition. However, the effects of P4 on adaptive immune responses are poorly understood. In this study, we took a novel approach by comparing the effects of P4 supplementation longitudinally, with treatment using a P4 antagonist mifepristone (RU486) in mid-trimester pregnancies. Thus, we were able to demonstrate the immune-modulatory functions of P4. We show that, in pregnancy, the immune system is increasingly activated (CD38, CCR6) with greater antigen-specific cytotoxic T cell responses (granzyme B). Simultaneously, pregnancy promotes a tolerant immune environment (IL-10 and regulatory-T cells) that gradually reverses prior to the onset of labor. P4 suppresses and RU486 enhances antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell inflammatory cytokine (IFN-{$\gamma$}) and cytotoxic molecule release (granzyme B). P4 and RU486 effectively modulate immune cell-mediated interactions, by regulating differentiated memory T cell subset sensitivity to antigen stimulation. Our results indicate that P4 and RU486, as immune modulators, share a reciprocal relationship. These data unveil key contributions of P4 to the modulation of the maternal immune system and suggests targets for future modulation of maternal immune function during pregnancy.},

Research on sickness behavior in humans has lagged behind non-human animal research due to methodological complexities. Here we review what is known about sickness behavior in humans, the effects of various hormones on sickness behavior, the possible role of cytokine gene variation in influencing sickness behavior responses, and the ways in which culture and gender norms could similarly influence these behavioral changes.

This susceptibility may be due to the evolution of our large, complex brains, or perhaps because these illnesses counterintuitively confer some adaptive advantage. Additionally, cultural and biological factors may contribute to susceptibility and variation in mental illness experience and expression. Taking a holistic perspective could strengthen our understanding of these illnesses in diverse cultural contexts. OBJECTIVES: This paper reviews some of these potential~factors and contextualizes mental disorders within a biocultural framework. RESULTS: There is growing evidence that suggests cultural norms may influence inflammation, neurotransmitters, and neurobiology, as well as the illness experience. Specific examples include variation in schizophrenia delusions between countries, differences in links between inflammation and emotion between the United States and Japan, and differences in brain activity between Caucasian and Asian participants indicating that cultural values may moderate cognitive processes related to social cognition and interoception. CONCLUSIONS: Research agendas that are grounded in an appreciation of biocultural diversity as it relates to psychiatric illness represent key areas for truly interdisciplinary research that can result in culturally sensitive treatments and highlight possible biological variation affecting medical treatment.},

  abstract = {Sickness behavior is an evolutionarily conserved phenomenon found across a diverse range of animals and involves a change in motivational priorities to theoretically maximize energetic investment in immune function and recovery. Typical components of sickness behavior include reduced sociability and activity, changes in diet, and depressed affect. Importantly, however, sickness behavior appears to be subject to other demands of life history in animal models, including reproduction and offspring survival. Thus, "feeling sick" is often context dependent with possible effects on morbidity and mortality. While humans may not always face the same life history tradeoffs, sociocultural norms and values may similarly shape sickness behavior by establishing internalized parameters for "socially appropriate sickness." We explore the role of these factors in shaping sickness behavior by surveying a national US sample (n = 1,259). Self-reported and recalled sickness behavior was measured using the SicknessQ instrument, which has previously been validated against experimentally induced sickness behavior. After post-stratification weighting and correction for Type I error, generalized linear models show that sickness behavior is significantly affected by various factors across sex and racial/ethnic groupings. Income below the national mean (b = 1.85, adj. p = 0.025), stoic endurance of pain and discomfort (b = 1.61, adj. p {$<$} 0.001), and depressive symptomology (b = 0.53, adj. p {$<$} 0.001) were each associated with greater sickness behavior scores. Familism (b = 1.59, adj. p = 0.008) was positively associated with sickness behavior in men, but not women. Endurance of pain and discomfort was associated with greater sickness behavior in Whites only (b = 1.94, adj. p = 0.002), while familism approached significance in African Americans only (b = 1.86, adj. p = 0.057). These findings may reflect different social contexts of sickness across demographic groups, which may in turn have important implications for pathogen transmission and recovery times, potentially contributing to health disparities.Tables: 4},

  abstract = {5. ConclusionsGender remains strongly associated with women's and men's patterns of unpaid work. The amount of time invested in unpaid work as opposed to paid work, the distribution of unpaid work time among specific tasks, and the patterns of care and responsibility are all determined to a large degree by one's gender. Women continue to spend more time than men on housework, whether they are employed or not; they continue to do more of the work involved in caring for children and to take more responsibility for that work; and finally, women's volunteer activities are more likely to be related to family than are men's.There have been numerous attempts to explain the gendered patterns of time spent on housework and childcare and, although there is support for each of them, none can fully account for the gendered patterns of unpaid work time. The gender display approach offers some hope for better understanding the relationship between gender and unpaid work time, but efforts to evaluate its usefulness are necessarily indirect. That is, there is no simple way to determine the extent to which unpaid work time is an expression of gender; we can only determine whether a particular pattern is consistent with the gender display model.It remains clear that the nature of women's and men's participation in housework, childcare and volunteer work are different and that changes in women's labor force participation are not sufficient to eliminate gender differences in unpaid work activities.},

  abstract = {Understanding factors contributing to variation in `biological age' is essential to understanding variation in susceptibility to disease and functional decline. One factor that could accelerate biological aging in women is reproduction. Pregnancy is characterized by extensive, energetically-costly changes across numerous physiological systems. These `costs of reproduction' may accumulate with each pregnancy, accelerating biological aging. Despite evidence for costs of reproduction using molecular and demographic measures, it is unknown whether parity is linked to commonly-used clinical measures of biological aging. We use data collected between 1999 and 2010 from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (n\,=\,4418) to test whether parity (number of live births) predicted four previously-validated composite measures of biological age and system integrity: Levine Method, homeostatic dysregulation, Klemera\textendash Doubal method biological age, and allostatic load. Parity exhibited a U-shaped relationship with accelerated biological aging when controlling for chronological age, lifestyle, health-related, and demographic factors in post-menopausal, but not pre-menopausal, women, with biological age acceleration being lowest among post-menopausal women reporting between three~and four live births. Our findings suggest a link between reproductive function and physiological dysregulation, and allude to possible~compensatory mechanisms that buffer the effects of reproductive function on physiological dysregulation during a woman's reproductive lifespan. Future work should continue to investigate links between parity, menopausal status, and biological age using targeted physiological measures and longitudinal studies.},

In particular, I suggest that recent research indicates that we may be very close to, if not already at, the point where we can genetically engineer factory-farmed livestock with a reduced or completely eliminated capacity to suffer. In as much as animal suffering is the principal concern that motivates the animal welfare movement, this development should be of central interest to its adherents. Moreover, I will argue that all people concerned with animal welfare should agree that we ought to replace the animals currently used in factory farming with animals whose ability to suffer is diminished if we are able to do so.},

In these provocative essays, one of the most brilliant advocates of cultural psychology reminds us that cultural differences in mental life lie at the heart of any understanding of the human condition. Drawing on ethnographic studies of the distinctive modes of psychological functioning in communities around the world, Richard Shweder explores ethnic and cultural differences in ideals of gender, in the life of the emotions, in conceptions of mature adulthood and the stages of life, and in moral judgments about right and wrong. Shweder, a cultural pluralist, dares readers to broaden their own conceptions of what is good, true, beautiful, and efficient and to take a closer look at specific cultural practices--parent/child cosleeping, arranged marriage, male and female genital modifications--that we may initially find alien or disturbing. He invites us to reject both radical relativism (the view that whatever is, is okay) and imperial visions of universal progressive cultural development (for example, the idea that "the West is Best") and to engage in more deeply informed cultural critique. The knowable world, Shweder observes, is incomplete if seen from any one point of view, incoherent if seen from all points of view at once, and empty if seen from nowhere in particular. This work strives for the "view from manywheres" in a culturally diverse yet interdependent world.},

Humans form close, enduring, cooperative relationships with nonrelatives. In these relationships, which we call friendships, both emotional and material support are exchanged. If these relationships are shaped by the adaptive logic of Tit-For-Tat reciprocal altruism, then we would expect people to keep track of benefits given to and received from friends, and for there to be contingencies between favors given now and favors received in the past. However, the social science literature suggests that Tit-for-Tat reciprocity is characteristic of relationships among casual acquaintances and strangers, not among friends. A considerable body of empirical work indicates that people value balanced reciprocity in their relationships with friends, but avoid keeping careful count of benefits given and received, and are offended when friends reciprocate immediately and directly. Thus, the dynamic of friendship does not fit the logic of models of reciprocity and presents a puzzle for evolutionary analysis.},

  abstract = {Background. Little is known about the mental health of partners of survivors of high levels of trauma in post-conflict countries. Method. We studied 677 spouse dyads (n = 1354) drawn from a community survey (response 82.4\%) in post-conflict Timor-Leste. We used culturally adapted measures of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), psychological distress, explosive anger and grief. Results. Latent class analysis identified three classes of couples: class 1, comprising women with higher trauma events (TEs), men with intermediate TEs (19\%); class 2, including men with higher TEs, women with lower TEs (23\%); and class 3, comprising couples in which men and women had lower TE exposure (58\%) (the reference group). Men and women partners of survivors of higher TE exposure (classes 1 and 2) had increased symptoms of explosive anger and grief compared with the reference class (class 3). Women partners of survivors of higher TE exposure (class 2) had a 20-fold increased rate of PTSD symptoms compared with the reference class, a pattern that was not evident for men living with women exposed to higher levels of trauma (class 1). Conclusions. Men and women living with survivors of higher levels of trauma showed an increase in symptoms of grief and explosive anger. The manifold higher rate of PTSD symptoms amongst women living with men exposed to high levels of trauma requires replication. It is important to assess the mental health of partners when treating survivors of high levels of trauma in post-conflict settings.},

Although a number of hypotheses about this health disparity between men and women have been advanced, none consider the importance of subjectively experienced anger. Drawing on theoretical and empirical insights from the sociology of emotion, we hypothesize that: (1. intense and persistent anger are associated with more symptoms of depression, and (2. sex differences in the intensity and persistence of anger are involved in the sex difference in depressed affect. Analyses of data from the 1996 GSS Emotions Module provide support for these two hypotheses and strongly suggest that women's intense and persistent anger play a pivotal role in their high rate of depression. We discuss the extent to which sex differences in these emotions are a function of social factors, biological factors, or a complex interaction between them. We also comment on the implications of our findings for future theory and research on gender, emotion and mental health.},

A spate of new papers has been published on well known and less familiar syndromes, and there have been a number of attempts to put some order into the field of inquiry. In a review of the literature on culture-bound syndromes up to 1969 Yap made certain suggestions for organizing thinking about them which for the most part have not received general acceptance (see Carr, this volume, p. 199). Through the seventies new descriptive and conceptual work was scarce, but in the last few years books and papers discussing the field were authored or edited by Tseng and McDermott (1981), AI-Issa (1982), Friedman and Faguet (1982) and Murphy (1982). In 1983 Favazza summarized his understanding of the state of current thinking for the fourth edition of the Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry, and a symposium on culture-bound syndromes was organized by Kenny for the Eighth International Congress of Anthropology and Ethnology. The strong est impression to emerge from all this recent work is that there is no substantive consensus, and that the very concept, "culture-bound syndrome" could well use some serious reconsideration. As the role of culture-specific beliefs and prac tices in all affliction has come to be increasingly recognized it has become less and less clear what sets the culture-bound syndromes apart.},

From an evolutionary perspective, Western diets are thus deficient in {$\omega$}-3 fatty acids. This is problematic as while {$\omega$}-3 and {$\omega$}-6 fatty acids are important components of practically all cell membranes, they are not interconvertible in the human body. Moreover, a balanced ratio of {$\omega$}-6 to {$\omega$}-3 fatty acids is required for homeostasis and normal development. Excessive amounts of {$\omega$}-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and a very high {$\omega$}-6/{$\omega$}-3 ratio, as is found in today's Western diets, promote the pathogenesis of many diseases including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. On the contrary, increased levels of {$\omega$}-3 PUFA (a lower {$\omega$}-6/{$\omega$}-3 ratio) exert suppressive effects. We thus recommend that {$\omega$}-3 and {$\omega$}-6 fatty acids should be distinguished on food labels because they both are metabolically and functionally distinct and have opposing physiological effects. We further argue that a lower ratio of {$\omega$}-6/{$\omega$}-3 fatty acids is desirable as it is likely to reduce the risk of many of the chronic diseases of high prevalence in Western societies, as well as in the developing countries.},

In this article, we argue that anger communication conveys an implied threat, and we document that issuing threats is a more effective negotiation strategy than communicating anger. In 3 computer-mediated negotiation experiments, participants received either angry or threatening messages from a simulated counterpart. Experiment 1 showed that perceptions of threat mediated the effect of anger (vs. a control) on concessions. Experiment 2 showed that (a) threat communication elicited greater concessions than anger communication and (b) poise (being confident and in control of one's own feelings and decisions) ascribed to the counterpart mediated the positive effect of threat compared to anger on concessions. Experiment 3 replicated this positive effect of threat over anger when recipients had an attractive alternative to a negotiated agreement. These findings qualify previous research on anger communication in negotiation. Implications for the understanding of emotion and negotiation are discussed.},

Rapidly changing oceans have led to decreased fish stocks globally, reducing the only historically consistent means of survival since the establishment of this community. Consequently, social pressures seek to end unsustainable fishing practices, but local conservation efforts\textemdash driven by the booming ecotourism industry of Utila\textemdash target these small-scale fisheries despite their marginal impact on marine ecosystems while adjacent fleet fishing operations, climate change, and pollution continue. Resulting mitigation strategies implemented by the community are focused on avoiding traditional fishing practices that constitute their collective identity, threatening many aspects of their life including their economy, diets, practices of learning, and communal reciprocity. However, in the midst of forced change, young members of the community are seeking to repurpose their traditional ecological knowledge in an attempt to carve occupational niches as tourist divers during this ontological crisis, reproducing themselves as wage laborers by transitioning their interactions with fish, from resources for extractions to subjects of spectating. These young community members face many challenges as their population remains geographically and socially excluded from ecotourist industries, which are largely left to the growing expatriate population. Through persistence, some individuals demonstrate their capacity to adapt to this adjacent vocation by utilizing their place-based fisherman knowledge to compete with local actors.},

  abstract = {Major life stressors, especially those involving interpersonal stress and social rejection, are among the strongest proximal risk factors for depression. In this review, we propose a biologically plausible, multilevel theory that describes neural, physiologic, molecular, and genomic mechanisms that link experiences of social-environmental stress with internal biological processes that drive depression pathogenesis. Central to this social signal transduction theory of depression is the hypothesis that experiences of social threat and adversity up-regulate components of the immune system involved in inflammation. The key mediators of this response, called proinflammatory cytokines, can in turn elicit profound changes in behavior, which include the initiation of depressive symptoms such as sad mood, anhedonia, fatigue, psychomotor retardation, and social-behavioral withdrawal. This highly conserved biological response to adversity is critical for survival during times of actual physical threat or injury. However, this response can also be activated by modern-day social, symbolic, or imagined threats, leading to an increasingly proinflammatory phenotype that may be a key phenomenon driving depression pathogenesis and recurrence, as well as the overlap of depression with several somatic conditions including asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic pain, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and neurodegeneration. Insights from this theory may thus shed light on several important questions including how depression develops, why it frequently recurs, why it is strongly predicted by early life stress, and why it often co-occurs with symptoms of anxiety and with certain physical disease conditions. This work may also suggest new opportunities for preventing and treating depression by targeting inflammation.},

  abstract = {Objective: Numerous theories have proposed that acute and chronic stressors may exert a cumulative effect on life-span health by causing biological ``wear and tear,'' or allostatic load, which in turn promotes disease. Very few studies have directly tested such models, though, partly because of the challenges associated with efficiently assessing stress exposure over the entire life course. To address this issue, we developed the first online system for systematically assessing lifetime stress exposure, called the Stress and Adversity Inventory (STRAIN), and describe its initial validation here. Methods: Adults recruited from the community (n = 205) were administered the STRAIN, Childhood Trauma Questionnaire\textemdash Short Form, and Perceived Stress Scale, as well as measures of socioeconomic status, personality, social desirability, negative affect, mental and physical health complaints, sleep quality, computer-assessed executive function, and doctor-diagnosed general health problems and autoimmune disorders. Results: The STRAIN achieved high acceptability and was completed relatively quickly (mean = 18 minutes 39 seconds; interquartile range = 12\textendash 23 minutes). The structure of the lifetime stress data best fit two latent classes overall and five distinct trajectories over time. Concurrent associations with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire\textemdash Short Form and Perceived Stress Scale were good (r values = .147\textendash.552). Moreover, the STRAIN was not significantly related to personality traits or social desirability characteristics and, in adjusted analyses, emerged as the measure most strongly associated with all six of the health and cognitive outcomes assessed except current mental health complaints ({$\beta$} values = .16\textendash.41; risk ratios = 1.02\textendash 1.04). Finally, test-retest reliability for the main stress exposure indices over 2\textendash 4 weeks was excellent (r values = .904\textendash.919). Conclusions: The STRAIN demonstrated good usability and acceptability; very good concurrent, discriminant, and predictive validity; and excellent test-retest reliability.},

According to Social Safety Theory, these experiences greatly impact human health and behavior because a fundamental goal of the brain and immune system is to keep the body biologically safe. To achieve this crucial goal, social threats likely gained the ability to activate anticipatory neural-immune responses that would have historically benefited reproduction and survival; the presence of social safety, in turn, likely dampened these responses. Viewing positive and negative social experiences through this lens affords a biologically based evolutionary account for why certain stressors are particularly impactful. It also provides an integrated, multi-level framework for investigating the biopsychosocial roots of psychopathology, health disparities, aging, longevity, and interpersonal cognition and behavior. Ultimately, this work has the potential to inform new strategies for reducing disease risk and promoting resilience.},

Prior studies have documented that maternal experiences of IPV are associated with adverse psychological and physical health outcomes in children; however, research on the underlying physiological pathways linking IPV to these conditions is limited. Drawing on data from the 2010 Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey, we examined the relationship between maternal report of IPV in the past 12 months and inflammation among children ages 6 months to 5 years. Our study included 503 children who were randomly selected to provide a blood sample and had a mother who had ever been married and who had completed the Domestic Violence Module, which collected information on physical, sexual, and emotional violence. Analyses were stratified based on a threshold for acute immune activation status, defined by the threshold of CRP {$>$} 1.1\,mg/L for young children in Tanzania. In bivariate analyses, healthy children whose mothers reported IPV showed a marginally elevated median CRP level compared to children whose mothers did not report IPV (0.35 vs. 0.41\,mg/L; p = 0.13). Similarly, among children with active or recent infections, those whose mothers reported IPV had an elevated median CRP compared to children whose mothers did not (4.06 vs 3.09\,mg/L; p = 0.03). In adjusted multiple variable regression models to account for child, mother, and household characteristics, maternal IPV was positively associated with (log) CRP in both healthy children and children with active or recent infection. Although longitudinal research with additional biomarkers of inflammation is needed, our results provide support for the hypothesis that inflammation may function as a biological pathway linking maternal IPV to poor psychological and physical health outcomes among children of mothers who are victimized-and this may extend to very young children and children in non-Western contexts.},

We compared social judgments about male and female victims of heterosexual and homosexual rape and tested hypotheses concerning social cognitions that are assumed to underlie a male rape mythology. In a 2 \texttimes{} 2 \texttimes{} 2 design, 77 male and 89 female subjects made a series of judgments about a sexual assault case in which sex of victim and sex of assailants were manipulated. Consistent with the hypotheses, the male victim of sexual assault by females was judged more likely to have initiated or encouraged the sex acts, and more enjoyment and less stress were attributed to him. This pattern of results was more pronounced among male subjects. The results are discussed in relation to stereotypic beliefs concerning male sex roles, sexual motivation, and sexual functioning that are likely to affect the social cognitions of both observers and male victims of heterosexual assault.},

We find that voice pitch does relate to foraging reputation in men, but not in women, with better hunters having a lower voice pitch. In addition, we find that the previously documented relationship between voice pitch and reproductive success no longer holds when controlling for hunting reputation, but hunting reputation remains a significant predictor of reproductive success when controlling for voice pitch.

Handgrip strength and weight status have been independently associated with depressive symptoms in older adults, but no study has yet investigated the relationships between all three in older US adults. This study investigated the relationship between physical function and depressive symptoms by weight status in older US adults. Methods Cross-sectional data were analysed from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey waves 2011 to 2012 and 2013 to 2014. Physical function was assessed using a grip strength dynamometer. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the self-reported Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Weight status was assessed using Body Mass Index (BMI) and participants were categorised as normal weight ({$<$}\,25\,kg/m2), overweight (25 to\,{$<$}\,30\,kg/m2), and obese ({$\geq$}\,30.0\,kg/m2). Associations between depressive symptoms and hand grip strength were estimated by gender-specific multiple linear regressions and BMI stratified multivariable linear regression. Results A total of 2,812 adults (54\% female, mean age 69.2 years, mean BMI 29.2\,kg/m2) were included. Women with moderate to severe depressive symptoms had 1.60\,kg (95\% CI: 0.91 to 2.30) lower hand grip strength compared to women with minimal or no depressive symptoms. No such association was observed in men. Among those with obesity, men (-3.72\,kg, 95\% CI: -7.00 to -0.43) and women (-1.83\,kg, 95\% CI: -2.87 to -0.78) with moderate to severe depressive symptoms both had lower handgrip strength. Conclusion Among older US adults, women and people who are obese and depressed are at the greatest risk of decline in physical function.},

  abstract = {Background Low handgrip strength has been shown to be associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms. One area of mental health that is understudied in relation to grip strength is chronic stress, which can exist independently to depression, or as a comorbidity or precursor to this condition. The present study examined cross-sectional associations between grip strength, an established marker of physical function, and (a) depressive symptoms and (b) chronic stress utilizing hair cortisol concentrations, while accounting for multiple pertinent confounding variables. Method Data were used from wave 6 (2012/13) of the English Longitudinal Study of Aging, a panel study of older ({$\geq$}50 years) community-dwelling men and women. Grip strength was measured in kg using a hand-held dynamometer. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the 8-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale. Hair cortisol concentrations (pg/mg) were determined from samples of scalp hair and log-transformed for analysis to correct skewness. Associations of grip strength with depressive symptoms and hair cortisol concentration were tested using linear regression models adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, wealth, smoking status, physical activity, body mass index, limiting long-standing illness, arthritis, diabetes, and hair treatment. Results The sample comprised of 3741 participants (mean age 68.4 years, 66.4\% female). After adjustment for age and sex, grip strength was significantly and negatively associated with both depressive symptoms (B = -0.038, SE = 0.004, P {$<$} 0.001) and hair cortisol (B = -0.003, SE = 0.001, P = 0.029). However, in the fully-adjusted models, both associations were attenuated and only the association with depressive symptoms remained statistically significant (B = -0.015, SE = 0.004, P {$<$} 0.001; hair cortisol B = -0.002, SE = 0.001, P = 0.088). Conclusion In a large sample of older adults in England, grip strength was negatively associated with depressive symptoms. Results were inconclusive regarding the association between grip strength and chronic stress. Further research examining the longitudinal relationships between muscular strength and specific aspects of mental health, while also exploring the neurobiological mechanisms underlying these associations, is warranted before recommendations for policy and practice can be made.},

  abstract = {Background: Depression occurs about twice as often in women as in men, a disparity that remains poorly understood. In a previous publication, Hagen and Rosenstr\textasciidieresis om predicted and found that grip strength, a highly sexually dimorphic index of physical formidability, mediated much of the effect of sex on depression. Striking results like this are more likely to be published than null results, potentially biasing the scientific record. It is therefore critical to replicate and extend them. Methodology: Using new data from the 2013\textendash 14 cycle of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a nationally representative sample of US households (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 3650), we replicated models of the effect of sex and grip strength on depression reported in Hagen and Rosenstr\textasciidieresis om, along with additional potential confounds and a new detailed symptom-level exploration. Results: Overall, the effects from the original paper were reproduced although with smaller effect sizes. Grip strength mediated 38\% of the effect of sex on depression, compared to 63\% in Hagen and Rosenstro\textasciidieresis m. These results were extended with findings that grip strength had a stronger association with some depression symptoms, like suicidality, low interest and low mood than with other symptoms, like appetite changes. Conclusions: Grip strength is negatively associated with depression, especially its cognitive\textendash affective symptoms, controlling for numerous possible confounds. Although many factors influence depression, few of these reliably occur cross-culturally in a sex-stratified manner and so are unlikely to explain the well-established, cross-cultural sex difference in depression. The sex difference in upper body strength occurs in all populations and is therefore a candidate evolutionary explanation for some of the sex difference in depression.},

The scale was tested for reliability and validity in an independent sample and demonstrates excellent reliability ({$\alpha~$}=~0.9123). Test-retest coefficients of the stress scale are also strong (r~=~0.8344, p~=~0.0000). Qualitative analyses indicated three major sources of stress: work, family, and community. Emotional aspects of stress also emerged, demonstrating a cultural perspective of stress closely related to feelings of despair and not being able to find a way out of despairing situations.

We utilise the Indonesia Family Life Survey (IFLS), a longitudinal survey which collected data from 1993 to 2015, to compare desired future fertility for 9655 couples and follow couples who had divergent preferences. The majority of couples (64.8\%) want the same number of future offspring. In 20.7\% of couples, husbands want more future offspring than their wives, while the reverse occurs in 14.5\% of couples. Living in villages with the husband's or the wife's parent(s) is associated with having divergent preferences for future offspring, where there is a higher likelihood that women prefer more offspring than their husbands. When examining fertility outcomes, women, particularly those who marry at older ages, are more likely to achieve their desired preference. Contrary to previous research, we do not find that living near one's natal kin or having increased autonomy increases an individual's likelihood of achieving desired fertility outcomes.},

  abstract = {In this article I evaluate recent attempts to illuminate the human infant cry from an evolutionary perspective. Infants are born into an uncertain parenting environment, which can range from indulgent care of offspring to infanticide. Infant cries are in large part adaptations that maintain proximity to and elicit care from caregivers. Although there is not strong evidence for acoustically distinct cry types, infant cries may function as a graded signal. During pain-induced autonomic nervous system arousal, for example, neural input to the vocal cords increases cry pitch. Caregivers may use this acoustic information, together with other cues, to guide caregiving behavior. Serious pathology, on the other hand, results in chronically and severely abnormal cry acoustics. Such abnormal crying may be a proximate cause of adaptive infant maltreatment, in circumstances in which parents cut their losses and reduce or withdraw investment from infants with low survival chances. An increase in the amount of crying during the first few months of life is a human universal, and excessive crying, or colic, represents the upper end of this normal increase. Potential signal functions of excessive crying include manipulation of parents to acquire additional resources, honest signaling of need, and honest signaling of vigor. Current evidence does not strongly support any one of these hypotheses, but the evidence is most consistent with the hypothesis that excessive early infant crying is a signal of vigor that evolved to reduce the risk of a reduction or withdrawal of parental care.}

But how did the rise in banana consumption in the United States affect the banana-growing regions of Central America? In this lively, interdisciplinary study, John Soluri integrates agroecology, anthropology, political economy, and history to trace the symbiotic growth of the export banana industry in Honduras and the consumer mass market in the United States.Beginning in the 1870s when bananas first appeared in the U.S. marketplace, Soluri examines the tensions between the small-scale growers, who dominated the trade in the early years, and the shippers. He then shows how rising demand led to changes in production that resulted in the formation of major agribusinesses, spawned international migrations, and transformed great swaths of the Honduran environment into monocultures susceptible to plant disease epidemics that in turn changed Central American livelihoods. Soluri also looks at labor practices and workers' lives, changing gender roles on the banana plantations, the effects of pesticides on the Honduran environment and people, and the mass marketing of bananas to consumers in the United States. His multifaceted account of a century of banana production and consumption adds an important chapter to the history of Honduras, as well as to the larger history of globalization and its effects on rural peoples, local economies, and biodiversity.},

  abstract = {Post-industrial societies have witnessed a sharp increase in the incidence of many immune diseases (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease, type-1 diabetes and allergies) during the last decades. Concomitantly, the same countries have gone through major human-driven environmental changes that have resulted in improved hygiene, sanitation and medical treatments. These environmental changes have produced a mismatch between the environment our immune system has evolved with and our current environment. It has therefore been suggested that the current ``epidemics'' of immune disorders might result from the lack of proper ``stimulation and/or regulation'' of the immune system by microorganisms and metazoan parasites that the human immune system has evolved to tolerate. Although this idea has attracted considerable attention, it is important to provide a complete account of the evolutionary forces that might lead microorganisms and parasites to induce immunopathology or protect the host from immune disorders. In this chapter, we review why parasites can indeed confer a protection towards overzealous immune functioning for their own interest. We will also discuss how taking evolutionary thinking into account can guide medical decision-making and improve the way diseases that arise from a dysregulated immune response are dealt with.},

  abstract = {Depression has been associated with inflammatory pathophysiological mechanisms, including alterations in amount of circulating immune cells. However, no meta-analysis within the past 20 years have reevaluated the circulating immune cells in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with depression compared to healthy controls. The aim of this study was to systematically evaluate the circulating immune cells in blood and CSF from patients with unipolar depression compared to healthy controls. Databases were searched up until February 12, 2021. Data-extraction was performed by two independent reviewers. 104 studies were included in the meta-analysis using fixed and random-effects models. Patients with depression had a significantly higher overall leukocyte count (35 studies; SMD, 0.46; 95\% CI: 0.31\textendash 0.60, I2\,=\,68\%), higher neutrophil count (24 studies; SMD, 0.52; 95\% CI: 0.33\textendash 0.71, I2\,=\,77\%) and higher monocyte count (27 studies; SMD, 0.32; 95\% CI: 0.11\textendash 0.53, I2\,=\,77\%) compared to healthy controls. Leukocyte counts were higher in inpatients, indicating a relation to depression severity. Furthermore, there were significant alterations in several lymphocyte subsets, including higher natural killer cells and T cell subsets. Higher neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (11 studies; SMD\,=\,0.24; 95\% CI: 0.06\textendash 0.42, I2\,=\,73\%), CD4/CD8 cell-ratio (26 studies; SMD\,=\,0.14; 95\% CI: 0.01\textendash 0.28, I2\,=\,42\%) and T helper 17/T regulatory ratio (2 studies; SMD\,=\,1.05; 95\% CI: 0.15\textendash 1.95, I2\,=\,86\%) were found in patients compared to healthy controls. CSF white cell count was higher in patients compared to controls (3 studies; SMD\,=\,0.20; 95\% CI: 0.01\textendash 0.38, I2\,=\,0\%). There were no data for CSF cell subsets. This study suggests that there are several blood immune cell alterations in patients with unipolar depression compared to healthy controls, both in major leukocyte subsets and more specialized immune cell subsets.},

The dominant position in the field is that religious beliefs and behaviors are byproducts of cognitive processes and behaviors that evolved for other purposes. A smaller group of scholars maintain that religion is an adaptation for extending human cooperation and coordination. Here I survey five critiques of the adapationist position and offer responses to these critiques. Much of the debate can be resolved by clearly defining important but ambiguous terms in the debate, such as religion, adaptation, adaptive, and trait, as well as clarifying several misunderstandings of evolutionary processes. I argue that adaptationist analyses must focus on the functional effects of the religious system, the coalescence of independent parts that constitute the fabric of religion.},

This experience enables the co-ordination of memory retrieval processes and can be acted on metacognitively. In successful retrieval, the feeling of remembering may be accompanied by recall of important contextual information. On the other hand, when people fail (or struggle) to retrieve information, other feelings, thoughts, and information may come to mind. In this review, we examine the subjective and metacognitive basis of episodic memory function from a neurodevelopmental perspective, looking at recollection paradigms (such as source memory, and the report of recollective experience) and metacognitive paradigms such as the feeling of knowing). We start by considering healthy development, and provide a brief review of the development of episodic memory, with a particular focus on the ability of children to report first-person experiences of remembering. We then consider neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) such as amnesia acquired in infancy, autism, Williams syndrome, Down syndrome, or 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. This review shows that different episodic processes develop at different rates, and that across a broad set of different NDDs there are various types of episodic memory impairment, each with possibly a different character. This literature is in agreement with the idea that episodic memory is a multifaceted process.},

  abstract = {Purpose The aim of the present study was to assess both the credibility and strength of evidence arising from systematic reviews with meta-analyses of observational studies on handgrip strength and health outcomes. Methods An umbrella review of systematic reviews with meta-analyses of observational studies was conducted. We assessed meta-analyses of observational studies based on random-effect summary effect sizes and their p values, 95\% prediction intervals, heterogeneity, small-study effects, and excess significance. We graded the evidence from convincing (Class I) to weak (Class IV). Results From 504 articles returned in a search of the literature, 8 systematic reviews were included in our review, with a total of 11 outcomes. Overall, nine of the 11 of the outcomes reported nominally significant summary results (p {$<$} 0.05), with 4 associations surviving the application of the more stringent p value (p\,{$<$}\,10-6). No outcome presented convincing evidence. Three associations showed Class II evidence (i.e., highly suggestive): (1) higher handgrip values at baseline were associated with a minor reduction in mortality risk in the general population (n\,=\,34 studies; sample size\,=\,1,855,817; relative risk = 0.72, 95\% confidence interval (95\%CI): 0.67\textendash 0.78), (2) cardiovascular death risk in mixed populations (n\,=\,15 studies; relative risk\,=\,0.84, 95\%CI: 0.78\textendash 0.91), and (3) incidence of disability (n\,=\,7 studies; relative risk\,=\,0.76, 95\%CI: 0.66\textendash 0.87). Conclusion The present results show that handgrip strength is a useful indicator for general health status and specifically for early all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, as well as disability. To further inform intervention strategies, future research is now required to fully understand mechanisms linking handgrip strength scores to these health outcomes.},

Despite widespread evidence for recovery from injuries or survival despite impairments, apparent evidence for healthcare is given limited attention. Moreover, interpretations of Neanderthals' approach to injury and suffering sometimes assume a calculated or indifferent attitude to others. Here the authors review evidence for Neanderthal healthcare, drawing on a bioarchaeology of care approach and relating healthcare to other realms of Neanderthal social life. The authors argue that Neanderthal medical treatment and healthcare was widespread and part of a social context of strong pro-social bonds which was not distinctively different from healthcare seen in later contexts. They suggest that the time has come to accept Neanderthal healthcare as a compassionate and knowledgeable response to injury and illness, and to turn to other questions, such as cultural variation or the wider significance of healthcare in an evolutionary context.},

However, healthcare practices have been viewed primarily as an example of complex cultural behaviour, often discussed alongside symbolism or mortuary practices. Here we argue that care for the ill and injured is likely to have a long evolutionary history and to have been highly effective in improving health and reducing mortality risks. Healthcare provisioning can thus be understood alongside other collaborative `risk pooling' strategies such as collaborative hunting, food sharing and collaborative parenting. For Neanderthals in particular the selective advantages of healthcare provisioning would have been elevated by a variety of ecological conditions which increased the risk of injury as well their particular behavioural adaptations which affected the benefits of promoting survival from injury and illness. We argue that healthcare provisioning was not only a more significant evolutionary adaptation than has previously been acknowledged, but moreover may also have been essential to Neanderthal occupation at the limits of the North Temperate Zone.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A major change in DSM-IV is the inclusion in almost one-half of the diagnostic criteria sets of a clinical significance criterion, which requires that symptoms cause ``clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.'' In response to concerns that the DSM criteria are overly inclusive, the clinical significance criterion attempts to minimize false positive diagnoses in situations in which the symptom criteria do not necessarily indicate pathology. This article examines whether the clinical significance criterion achieves its purpose and considers its broader impact on diagnostic validity. METHOD: The effect of the clinical significance criterion on the diagnostic validity of DSM-IV criteria for a wide range of disorders was examined. RESULTS: For many diagnoses to which the clinical significance criterion was added, the symptom criteria are inherently associated with significant impairment, so the clinical significance criterion is redundant and therefore does not affect caseness. For some diagnoses, the clinical significance criterion is potentially helpful in eliminating false positives by elevating the level of required distress. However, there may be advantages to obtaining the same results by modifying some of the symptom criteria. Often the clinical significance criterion has led to the possibility of false negative diagnoses. CONCLUSIONS: In the process of revising DSM-IV, the generic use of the clinical significance criterion should be reconsidered. For each DSM diagnosis, it should be determined whether there is a need to raise the threshold of any of the existing symptom criteria or to add a criterion that excludes normal reactions to psychosocial stress.},

The HD analysis is a substantial advance over previous attempts to define disorder in specifying the nature of what is not working in the individual (the dysfunction). The adoption of the HD analysis in DSM-V ( Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th ed.) would probably have little if any effect on the list of categories of mental disorders. Its main value would be in helping make revisions in the diagnostic criteria more valid as true indicators of disorder.

The current sample consistently assigned higher weights to events/items than did the original sample, but there was high agreement in terms of item ranking. Some distinct age and gender differences in scoring were apparent, and are discussed further. It was concluded that when separate weightings are employed for age and gender groups, the LEI remains a useful tool for quantifying background levels of stress in both workplace stress audits and epidemiological studies where statistical control for non-occupational sources of stress is required.},

  abstract = {{\.V}O2max and daily productivity (metric tons/day) have been measured in 46 sugar cane cutters 18 to 34 years of age. A multiple regression analysis demonstrated that productivity was simultaneously related to {\.V}O2max, height and body fat (r = 0.685; P \&lt; 0.001). The multiple regression equation was: productivity (tons/day) = 0.81 {\.V}O2max percent fat + 0.03 height - 1.96. The data indicate that productivity is affected indirectly by nutritional status through the influence of the latter on height, fat content and {\.V}O2max The decrease in {\.V}O2max that occurs with age was similar to that reported in the literature. Evidence is presented that, as the worker ages, a higher percent {\.V}O2max has to be utilized to maintain productivity.},

Evolutionary models emphasize biological sex differences and opportunity costs to understand this pattern of behaviour, yet deviations remain poorly understood. We examine variation in women's work among Shodagor fisher\textendash traders in Bangladesh with the goal of explaining such deviations related to women's work. First, we demonstrate that women's trading produces higher variance returns than men's work \textendash{} a pattern not previously quantified. Next, we test predictions from the economy of scale model to understand the socioecological circumstances associated with trading. We suggest that relaxing model assumptions around biological constraints may elucidate key circumstances under which members of one gender should systematically engage in work that is incompatible with childcare and/or produces higher levels of economic risk. Results indicate that biological sex differences are insufficient to explain gendered patterns of behaviour but removal of childcare constraints and comparative advantages related to opportunity costs can explain adherence to and deviation from trends in women's work and the division of labour.},

  abstract = {We critically review the use of the term ``life history theory'' in recent publications on evolutionary psychology, focusing on how the idea of a fast-slow continuum is deployed in that literature. We raise four issues: First, concerning plasticity, should we expect the effects of plasticity on the developmental response of a trait to mirror the effects of selection on the mean of that trait? We conclude that we should not. Do only plastic responses to harsh or unpredictable environments accelerate maturation, or are there plausible alternatives, such as nutrition? In many situations better nutrition is a plausible alternative. Second, how should we conceive of the harshness of an environment? It has several important dimensions. It could mean an increase in the mean mortality rate, a decrease in the mean growth rate or fertility rate, or increases in the variances of any of those rates. Our judgement of harshness will also be affected by the distribution of such effects across patches in space and through generations in time. The combination and distribution of effects make important differences to predictions. Third, where did the fast-slow idea come from, and how much does it explain? It was initially detected in comparisons across higher taxonomic levels, whose relevance to variation among individuals is unclear and where it fails to explain much of the variation. Fourth, what sorts of processes could generate the fast-slow pattern? Here we expand on insights mentioned earlier in passing to make clear how spatial population structure and class effects generate alternative predictions. We conclude with some thoughts on the nature of theories and research strategies and on how one might respond to empirical puzzles.},

We review evidence for each of these pathways, for several distinct emotions previously examined in the context of status attainment, status communication, or hierarchy navigation; these include certain highly social emotions (i.e., pride, shame, envy, contempt, and admiration) and more ``basic'' emotions (i.e., happiness, sadness, anger, disgust, and fear/anxiety). Together, the reviewed findings offer a number of insights regarding the importance of emotions for status negotiation processes, but considerable work remains, and we hope this review will serve as a foundation for future studies examining these issues from functionalist and evolutionary perspectives.},

  abstract = {Sickness was a crucial adaptive problem in the course of evolution, and one solution, particularly in humans, is support and care from in-group members. The social interaction between sufferers and (potential) helpers was a recurrent social situation throughout human evolution and its outcome was crucial for survival. Thus, respective selection pressures may have yielded specific behavioral adaptations for both the sufferer and the helper role. According to the present paper, it is important for the sufferer to communicate the sick state convincingly, while it is important for the helper to communicate the act of helping convincingly. Signaling strategies for the efficient pursuit of the respective goals are proposed, then the proposed strategies are substantiated with previous empirical evidence and theory. Many heterogeneous medical phenomena, such as the placebo effect, social modulation of pain, somatization, and overtreatment, are integrated in the argument. Thereby, the present paper contributes to a conceptual foundation for the evolutionary study of therapeutic encounters and the patient-practitioner relationship and thus may allow Darwinian medicine to study not only disease but also healing.},

  abstract = {A long-held and dominating view that cancer is a genetic disease caused by deterministic sequential mutations in a restricted number of cancer-driver genes (oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes), occurring in a continuous linear pattern of tumour progression, and directly determining the hallmarks of cancer, has now been disproved. This view is tied to the ``oncogene addiction'' concept: the idea that tumour cells are dependent on a single activated oncogenic protein or pathway to maintain their malignant properties. However, this has also been challenged by both the observation of tumour relapses after the inactivation of oncogene in mouse models and the failure of targeted therapies in clinical trials. In this chapter, we adopt an evolutionary perspective to consider that the majority of tumours contain a heterogeneous cell population with many random genome alterations and extensively rewired signalling networks. In this context, chromosome instability (CIN) drives genomic and (epi)genetic heterogeneity, rewires and creates new genetic networks due to the dynamic alterations of transcriptome/proteome, and eventually generates the diverse tumour cell phenotype variants, which constitutes the basis for cancer evolutionary selection and multidrug resistance. Any factors or stresses, including chemotherapy, that contribute to CIN may promote the evolution of cancer. In this chapter, we review (i) the genome theory of cancer, (ii) the role of CIN for cancer evolution, and (iii) why cancer mouse models do not recapitulate a natural tumour. The implications of a stochastic model of genome evolution for chemotherapy are discussed.},

Participants had data on personality traits, demographic factors, grip strength, and mediators such as depressive symptoms, physical activity, body mass index (BMI), and c-reactive protein (CRP). Results Across all samples and a meta-analysis, higher neuroticism was related to lower grip strength (meta-analytic estimate: -0.07, 95\%CI: -0.075; -0.056). Higher extraversion (0.04, 95\%CI: 0.022; 0.060), openness (0.05, 95\%CI: 0.032; 0.062), and conscientiousness (0.05, 95\%CI: 0.04; 0.065) were associated with higher grip strength across most samples and the meta-analysis. Depressive symptoms were the most consistent mediators between neuroticism and grip strength. Depressive symptoms and physical activity partly mediated the associations with extraversion, openness, and conscientiousness. Lower CRP partly mediated the association with conscientiousness. Sex moderated the associations for extraversion, openness, and conscientiousness, with stronger associations among males. Age moderated the neuroticism association, with stronger associations among younger individuals. Conclusion This study provides replicable evidence that personality is related to grip strength and identifies potential moderators and mediators of these associations. Overall, higher neuroticism is a risk factor for low grip strength, whereas high extraversion, openness, and conscientiousness may be protective.},

Chimp and bonobo societies are closed societies: with the exception of adolescent females who disperse from their natal group and join a nearby group (never to return to their group of origin), a pan residential group is the whole social world of the agents who make it up. That is not true of forager bands, which have fluid memberships, and regular associations with neighbouring bands. They are components of a larger social world. The open and fluid character of forager bands brings with it many advantages, so the stability of this more vertically complex form of social life is not difficult to explain, once it establishes. But how did it establish, if, as is likely, earlier hominin social worlds resemble those of our close pan relatives in the suspicion (even hostility) of one band to another? How did hominin social organisation transition from life in closed bands, each distrustful of its neighbours, to the much more open social lives of foragers? I will discuss and synthesise two approaches to this problem, one ecological, based on the work of Robert Layton and his colleagues, and another that is organised around an expansion of kin recognition, an idea primarily driven by Bernard Chapais. The paper closes by discussing potential archaeological signatures both of more open social worlds, and of the supposed causal drivers of such worlds.},

This study tests an alternative model (the harassment or sharing\textendash under\textendash pressure hypothesis) in which a food owner immediately benefits because sharing avoids costly harassment from a beggar. I present an experiment that varies the potential ability of the beggar to harass, and of the owner to defend the food, to examine the effects of harassment on food sharing in two primate species: chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and squirrel monkeys (Saimiri boliviensis). For both species, high levels of harassment potential significantly increased both beggar harassment and sharing by the owner. Food defensibility did not affect harassment or sharing. Interestingly, squirrel monkeys and chimpanzees shared equally frequently with conspecifics despite a much higher natural sharing rate in chimpanzees. These results suggest that harassment can play a significant role in primate food sharing, providing a simple alternative to reciprocity. The selfish nature of harassment has implications for economic, psychological and evolutionary studies of cooperative systems.},

  abstract = {This article looks at the evolution of sex differences in sexuality in human beings and asks whether evolutionary psychology sometimes exaggerates these differences. According to a common understanding of sexual selection theory, females in most species invest more than males in their offspring, and as a result, males compete for as many mates as possible, whereas females choose from among the competing males. The males-compete/females-choose (MCFC) model applies to many species but is misleading when applied to human beings. This is because males in our species commonly contribute to the rearing of the young, which reduces the sex difference in parental investment. Consequently, sex differences in our species are relatively modest. Rather than males competing and females choosing, humans have a system of mutual courtship: Both sexes are choosy about long-term mates, and both sexes compete for desirable mates. We call this the mutual mate choice (MMC) model. Although much of the evolutionary psychology literature is consistent with the MMC model, the traditional MCFC model exerts a strong influence on the field, distorting the emerging picture of the evolved sexual psychology of Homo sapiens. Specifically, it has led to the exaggeration of the magnitude of human sex differences, an overemphasis on men's short-term mating inclinations, and a relative neglect of male mate choice and female mate competition. We advocate a stronger focus on the MMC model.},

  abstract = {Objectives: We develop and test a conceptual model of factors influencing the likelihood of physical wife abuse. The paternal disinvestment model emphasizes that spousal conflict over resource use results from men's attempts to increase individual fitness at a cost to the family (e.g., through pursuit of extramarital affairs). We propose that men use violence to control women's responses to the diversion of resources away from the family: to quell women's objections to male disinvestment, maintain women's parental investment, and to dissuade women from pursuing relationships with other men. Methods: Interviews were conducted among men and women to determine rates of violence and demographic and behavioral covariates. Structural equation modeling and generalized estimating equations analyses were used to test predictions derived from the model. We also collected data on frequent complaints in marriage and women's perceptions of arguments precipitating violence. Results: Over 85\% of women experienced physical wife abuse (n = 49). Indicators of paternal disinvestment positively covary with indicators of marital strife and with rates of wife abuse. The wife's age, matrilocal residence, and presence of joint dependent offspring decrease the likelihood of violence through direct and indirect routes. Conclusions: Wife abuse is linked to the importance of paternal investment in human families, and is a means by which men control women's responses to a dual reproductive strategy of familial investment and pursuit of extramarital sexual relationships. This framework is more general than traditional sociological and evolutionary perspectives emphasizing patriarchy and men's sexual jealousy, respectively. Am. J. Hum.

  abstract = {The role of men's jealousy over a wife's infidelity in precipitating marital conflict and wife abuse is well documented. The role of women's jealousy over a husband's infidelity has received little attention, which is puzzling given high potential costs to women of withdrawal of paternal investment. We address this gap by investigating marital conflict and wife abuse among Tsimane forager\textendash farmers of Bolivia. We test predictions derived from male jealousy and paternal disinvestment hypotheses, which consider threats and consequences of infidelity by women (male jealousy hypothesis) and men (paternal disinvestment hypothesis). The paternal disinvestment hypothesis proposes that wife abuse is employed by husbands to limit wives' mate retention effort and maintain men's opportunities to pursue extrapair sexual relationships. Interviews were conducted among husbands and wives in the same marriages using a combination of open-ended and structured items. Spouses agree that the most frequently reported type of marital argument is women's jealousy over a husband's infidelity (N=266 arguments). Roughly 60\% of abusive events occurred during arguments over men's diversion of household resources (N=124 abusive events). In multivariate analyses, likelihood of wife abuse is greater in marriages where husbands have affairs, where wives are younger, and where spouses spend more time apart (N=60 husbands, 71 wives). While we find strong support for both male jealousy and paternal disinvestment hypotheses, it is men's infidelity, not women's, that precipitates most instances of marital conflict and wife abuse. We conclude that men's aggression towards their wives facilitates men's diversion of family resources for their selfish interests.},

Psychological well-being is the subject of significant scientific inquiry in large-scale modern societies (e.g., Easterlin, 2003; Blanchflower and Oswald, 2008; Diener and Chan, 2011), and it is often associated with economic productivity, social status, and network strength. However, very little is known about the evolutionary origins of mood variation or about mood variation during the course of human evolution. In fact, it has been suggested that depression is a maladaptive by-product of modern lifestyles due to inadequate pathogenic exposure in development, low physical activity level, high prevalence of metabolic disorder, or high levels of psychosocial stress from economic inequality, intense social competition, and residential isolation from kin (Raison et al., 2010; Rook et al., 2013).},

  abstract = {Sadness is an emotion universally recognized across cultures, suggesting it plays an important functional role in regulating human behavior. Numerous adaptive explanations of persistent sadness interfering with daily functioning (hereafter ``depression'') have been proposed, but most do not explain frequent bidirectional associations between depression and greater immune activation. Here we test several predictions of the host defense hypothesis, which posits that depression is part of a broader coordinated evolved response to infection or tissue injury (i.e. ``sickness behavior'') that promotes energy conservation and reallocation to facilitate immune activation. In a high pathogen population of lean and relatively egalitarian Bolivian forager\textendash horticulturalists, we test whether depression and its symptoms are associated with greater baseline concentration of immune biomarkers reliably associated with depression in Western populations (i.e. tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-a], interleukin-1 beta [IL-1b], interleukin-6 [IL-6], and C-reactive protein [CRP]). We also test whether greater pro-inflammatory cytokine responses to ex vivo antigen stimulation are associated with depression and its symptoms, which is expected if depression facilitates immune activation. These predictions are largely supported in a sample of older adult Tsimane (mean {$\pm$} SD age = 53.2 {$\pm$} 11.0, range = 34\textendash 85, n = 649) after adjusting for potential confounders. Emotional, cognitive and somatic symptoms of depression are each associated with greater immune activation, both at baseline and in response to ex vivo stimulation. The association between depression and greater immune activation is therefore not unique to Western populations. While our findings are not predicted by other adaptive hypotheses of depression, they are not incompatible with those hypotheses and future research is necessary to isolate and test competing predictions.},

We propose that depression is a consequence of functional disability, which can reduce subsistence productivity and resource transfers within and across generations. Social conflict can also disrupt resource flows and should be associated with depression. To evaluate depression among Tsimane forager-farmers of Bolivia, we developed a reliable interview based on focus groups and a review of validated depression scales. Older adults (mean {$\pm$} SD age = 62{$\pm$}9, n = 325) were recruited regardless of their health status. Demographic, economic, and medical data were collected during annual censuses and routine medical exams. Depression is associated with reduced energetic status, greater physical limitations, and reduced subsistence involvement after controlling for potential confounds such as age, sex, number of reported unresolved conflicts, and market involvement. Depression is also associated with greater reported conflict, particularly with non-kin.Tsimane depression is associated with disability, reduced subsistence productivity, and interpersonal conflict, all of which can disrupt resource flows. Depression appears to be a response to conditions regularly experienced over human history, and not simply a by-product of modernity.},

Quantifying the burden of impairment in subsistence populations is critical for understanding selection pressures underlying strategies that minimize risk of production deficits. We examine among forager-horticulturalists whether compromised bone strength (indicated by fracture and lower bone mineral density, BMD) is associated with subsistence task cessation. We also estimate the magnitude of productivity losses associated with compromised bone strength. Fracture is associated with cessation of hunting, tree chopping, and walking long distances, but not tool manufacture. Age-specific productivity losses from hunting cessation associated with fracture and lower BMD are substantial: \textasciitilde 397 lost kcals/day, with expected future losses of up to 1.9 million kcals (22\% of expected production). Productivity loss is thus substantial for high strength and endurance tasks. Determining the extent to which impairment obstructs productivity in contemporary subsistence populations improves our ability to infer past consequences of impairment.},

However, the evidence remains inconsistent and at most, makes the case for differences between rural and urban environments as a whole. Here, we propose a model of depression driven by an individual's accumulated experience mediated by social networks. The connection between observed systematic variations in socioeconomic networks and built environments with city size provides a link between urbanization and mental health. Surprisingly, this model predicts lower depression rates in larger cities. We confirm this prediction for US cities using four independent datasets. These results are consistent with other behaviors associated with denser socioeconomic networks and suggest that larger cities provide a buffer against depression. This approach introduces a systematic framework for conceptualizing and modeling mental health in complex physical and social networks, producing testable predictions for environmental and social determinants of mental health also applicable to other psychopathologies.},

In addition, we tested consistency in dimensionality results across different methods (parallel analysis, factor analysis, explained common variance, the partial credit model, and the Mokken model). Results showed that while both Patient Health Questionnaire\textendash 9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment\textendash 7 are multidimensional instruments with highly correlated factors, there is justification for sum scores as measures of severity. Temporal measurement invariance across 10 therapy sessions was evaluated. Strict temporal measurement invariance was established in both scales, allowing researchers to compare sum scores as severity measures across time.},

In the context of an earlier re-evaluation of the role of E. B. Tylor, it is argued here that in the work of Boas the concept was in fact provided with much of the basis of its modern anthropological meaning. In developing his argument against racial mental differences, Boas proceeded by showing that the behavior of all men, regardless of race or cultural stage, was determined by a traditional body of habitual behavior patterns passed on through what we would now call enculturative processes and buttressed by ethically tainted secondary rationalizations. The behavioral significance of the older humanist-evolutionist idea of culture was thus inverted, and the basis laid for the notion of culture as a primary determinant of behavior. The fundamental concepts \ldots{} in any of the disciplines of science are always left indeterminate at first and are only explained to begin with by reference to the realm of phenomena from which they were derived; it is only by means of a progressive analysis of the material of observation that they can be made clear and can find a significant and consistent meaning. Sigmund Freud (as quoted by Kroeber and Kluckhohn 1952:42) \ldots{} this attachment to inherited names appears much stronger as soon as we consider realities of a less material order. That is because the transformations in such cases almost always take place too slowly to be perceptible to the very men affected by them. They feel no need to change the label, because the change of content escapes them. Marc Bloch (1961:159)},

Further, disparities related to socioeconomic and foreign-born status impact the adverse physical and mental health outcomes as a result of IPV, further exacerbating these health consequences. This article reviews 36 U.S. studies on the physical (e.g., multiple injuries, disordered eating patterns), mental (e.g., depression, post-traumatic stress disorder), and sexual and reproductive health conditions (e.g., HIV/STIs, unintended pregnancy) resulting from IPV victimization among ethnic minority (i.e., Black/African American, Hispanic/Latina, Native American/Alaska Native, Asian American) women, some of whom are immigrants. Most studies either did not have a sufficient sample size of ethnic minority women or did not use adequate statistical techniques to examine differences among different racial/ethnic groups. Few studies focused on Native American/Alaska Native and immigrant ethnic minority women and many of the intra-ethnic group studies have confounded race/ethnicity with income and other social determinants of health. Nonetheless, of the available data, there is evidence of health inequities associated with both minority ethnicity and IPV. To appropriately respond to the health needs of these groups of women, it is necessary to consider social, cultural, structural, and political barriers (e.g., medical mistrust, historical racism and trauma, perceived discrimination, immigration status) to patient\textendash provider communication and help-seeking behaviors related to IPV, which can influence health outcomes. This comprehensive approach will mitigate the racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities related to IPV and associated health outcomes and behaviors.},

Design Individual participant data analysis. Population 232 randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trials of drug monotherapy for major depressive disorder submitted by drug developers to the FDA between 1979 and 2016, comprising 73 388 adult and child participants meeting the inclusion criteria for efficacy studies on antidepressants. Main outcome measures Responses were converted to Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD17) equivalent scores where other measures were used to assess efficacy. Multivariable analyses examined the effects of age, sex, baseline severity, and year of the study on improvements in depressive symptoms in the antidepressant and placebo groups. Response distributions were analyzed with finite mixture models. Results The random effects mean difference between drug and placebo favored drug (1.75 points, 95\% confidence interval 1.63 to 1.86). Differences between drug and placebo increased significantly (P{$<$}0.001) with greater baseline severity. After controlling for participant characteristics at baseline, no trends in treatment effect or placebo response over time were found. The best fitting model of response distributions was three normal distributions, with mean improvements from baseline to end of treatment of 16.0, 8.9, and 1.7 points. These distributions were designated Large, Non-specific, and Minimal responses, respectively. Participants who were treated with a drug were more likely to have a Large response (24.5\% v 9.6\%) and less likely to have a Minimal response (12.2.\% v 21.5\%). Conclusions The trimodal response distributions suggests that about 15\% of participants have a substantial antidepressant effect beyond a placebo effect in clinical trials, highlighting the need for predictors of meaningful responses specific to drug treatment.},

Stonich examines the systemic linkages among the dynamics of dominant development models and associated patterns of capitalist accumulation, regional demography, rural impoverishment, and environmental decline. By casting the discussion against the backdrop of southern Honduras, she presents a powerful historical record of how larger socio-political communities impact individuals and the natural environment and how, in turn, people respond. She charts the destiny of peasant groups within the dynamics of contemporary capitalism, recognizing that the fates of the peasantry and the natural environment are intimately linked.

  abstract = {Exogenous cannabinoids are structurally and pharmacologically diverse compounds that are widely used. The purpose of this systematic review is to summarize the data characterizing the potential for these compounds to act as substrates, inhibitors, or inducers of human drug metabolizing enzymes, with the aim of clarifying the significance of these properties in clinical care and drug interactions. In vitro data were identified that characterize cytochrome P-450 (CYP-450) enzymes as potential significant contributors to the primary metabolism of several exogenous cannabinoids: tetrahydrocannabinol (THC; CYPs 2C9, 3A4); cannabidiol (CBD; CYPs 2C19, 3A4); cannabinol (CBN; CYPs 2C9, 3A4); JWH-018 (CYPs 1A2, 2C9); and AM2201 (CYPs 1A2, 2C9). CYP-450 enzymes may also contribute to the secondary metabolism of THC, and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases have been identified as capable of catalyzing both primary (CBD, CBN) and secondary (THC, JWH-018, JWH-073) cannabinoid metabolism. Clinical pharmacogenetic data further support CYP2C9 as a significant contributor to THC metabolism, and a pharmacokinetic interaction study using ketoconazole with oromucosal cannabis extract further supports CYP3A4 as a significant metabolic pathway for THC and CBD. However, the absence of interaction between CBD from oromucosal cannabis extract with omeprazole suggests a less significant role of CYP2C19 in CBD metabolism. Studies of THC, CBD, and CBN inhibition and induction of major human CYP-450 isoforms generally reflect a low risk of clinically significant drug interactions with most use, but specific human data are lacking. Smoked cannabis herb (marijuana) likely induces CYP1A2 mediated theophylline metabolism, although the role of cannabinoids specifically in eliciting this effect is questionable.},

Artifact phylogenies are increasingly being used by archaeologists to infer, develop, and test hypotheses about the processes that originate and shape material culture sets, as well as to study the extent and rates of cultural innovation, borrowing, diffusion, convergence, and loss. As an analytical tool, cultural phylogenetics can also be used to test hypotheses about the emergence, change, and exchange of artifact types, thereby allowing researchers to make inferences about temporal and regional behavioral patterns. This chapter will review some basic concepts of cultural phylogenetics, discuss its applications in archaeology, and reflect on some of the main challenges and prospects faced by the field.},

Although we know much about human height, this information has rarely been brought together in a comprehensive, systematic fashion. Here, we present a synthetic review of the literature on human height from an explicit evolutionary perspective, addressing its phylogenetic history, development, and environmental and genetic influences on growth and stature. In addition to presenting evidence to suggest the past action of natural selection on human height, we also assess the evidence that natural and sexual selection continues to act on height in contemporary populations. Although there is clear evidence to suggest that selection acts on height, mainly through life-history processes but perhaps also directly, it is also apparent that methodological factors reduce the confidence with which such inferences can be drawn, and there remain surprising gaps in our knowledge. The inability to draw firm conclusions about the adaptiveness of such a highly visible and easily measured trait suggests we should show an appropriate degree of caution when dealing with other human traits in evolutionary perspective.},

Recent research suggests that juvenile mortality reduction could be achieved via provisioning to weaned juveniles, particularly during health crises. Here I test this idea with data on the causes, distribution, and duration of injuries and illnesses suffered by Shiwiar forager-horticulturalists during the juvenile period. Health insults for which prolonged care is necessary for survival are a recurrent feature of the juvenile lifespan. About half the individuals for whom data on disability duration were gathered suffered health insults likely to be lethal without extended aid; over 80\% were born after a parent suffered such an event; and over 90\% were born after a direct ancestor in the two ascending generations suffered such an event. The data indicate that health-care provisioning reduces juvenile mortality, and that provisioning of sick and injured juveniles has important fitness consequences in this population.},

Based on grounded theory, the authors assessed for common themes across transcripts. Authors found that a number of participants denied the existence of IPV. Perspectives on the causes and definitions of IPV varied between FCVs and MCLs. All participants affirmed the need for intervention and many participants mentioned healthcare and legal systems as potential venues to ameliorate IPV. The results highlight potentially important differences between FCV and MCL perspectives that may inform future interventions.

On the basis of a review of family, adoption, and twin studies that met specific inclusion criteria, the authors derived quantitative summary statistics. RESULTS: Five family studies met the inclusion criteria. The odds ratios for proband (subjects with major depression or comparison subjects) versus first-degree relative status (affected or unaffected with major depression) were homogeneous across the five studies (Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio=2.84, 95\% CI=2.31\textendash 3.49). No adoption study met the inclusion criteria, but the results of two of the three reports were consistent with genetic influences on liability to major depression. Five twin studies met the inclusion criteria, and their statistical summation suggested that familial aggregation was due to additive genetic effects (point estimate of heritability of liability=37\%, 95\% CI=31\%\textendash 42\%), with a minimal contribution of environmental effects common to siblings (point estimate=0\%, 95\% CI=0\%\textendash 5\%), and substantial individual-specific environmental effects/measurement error (point estimate=63\%, 95\% CI=58\%\textendash 67\%). The literature suggests that recurrence best predicts the familial aggregation of major depression. CONCLUSIONS: Major depression is a familial disorder, and its familiality mostly or entirely results from genetic influences. Environmental influences specific to an individual are also etiologically significant. Major depression is a complex disorder that does not result from either genetic or environmental influences alone but rather from both. These findings are notably consistent across samples and methods and are likely to be generally applicable.},

Stress accounted for 80\% of the indirect effect of abuse on women's physical health. Its direct effect on physical health was somewhat larger than its indirect effect through depression, but both processes played a key role in determining the effect of abuse on women's physical health problems. Furthermore, abuse was a stronger predictor of women's stress than was poverty. Implication and future research are discussed.},

  abstract = {Chronic heart failure (HF) occurs after a long period of cardiac remodelling, during which the heart manages to compensate due to changed working conditions induced by cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Cardiac hypertrophy and the reduction of the contractile capacity of the heart (V max) are the main components of this adaptive process. Cardiac hypertrophy is adaptive both by increasing the number of contractile units and by reducing the wall stress. The reduction of V max is adaptive by normalizing cardiac muscle economy. From an evolutionary perspective, the major goal of chronic HF treatment is thus to improve muscle economy, either by suppressing the cause of cardiac load (e.g. by treating valve disease or hypertension) or by reducing the loading conditions (e.g. with anti-aldosterone drugs, converting enzyme inhibitors or diuretics). Furthermore, an evolutionary perspective suggests that the prescription of positive inotropic agents to increase cardiac contractility is not indicated in chronic HF, as opposed to the case for acute HF. Thinking evolutionarily also provides new avenues for the establishment of prognostics and diagnostic biomarkers of HF. For instance, a comparative analysis reveals that the helical cardiac structure observed in every tetrapod is an adaptive cardiac feature. Thus, given that the early stages of cardiac overload are characterized by the impairment of systolic torsion, the quantification of cardiac torsion may provide a better marker for HF than the ejection fraction that is currently utilized by every clinician.},

Grip strength is a powerful predictor of disability, morbidity and mortality which has been used in a number of frailty scores but not as a single marker of frailty. Objective: to investigate the potential of grip strength as a single marker of frailty in older people of similar chronological age. Design: cross-sectional study with prospective collection of mortality data. Setting: North Hertfordshire, UK. Subjects: 717 men and women, aged 64\textendash 74, born and still living in North Hertfordshire, who took part in a previous study to investigate the relationship between size at birth and ageing processes in later life. Methods: the number of signiWcant associations between grip strength and the ageing markers was compared with numbers between chronological age and the ageing markers. Results: in men, lower grip strength correlated signiWcantly with ten ageing markers compared to chronological age which was signiWcantly associated with seven. In women, there were six signiWcant relationships for grip compared to three for age. The greater number of relationships between grip strength and ageing markers was not explained by the association between grip strength and age, and remained after adjustment for adult size. Conclusions: grip strength was associated with more markers of frailty than chronological age within the narrow age range studied. Grip strength may prove a more useful single marker of frailty for older people of similar age than chronological age alone. Its validity in a clinical setting needs to be tested.},

Despite over a century of research on this puzzling and tragic behavior, and a recent increase in the number of treatments and intervention programs, it remains a global scourge. There is abundant research on suicidality in Western populations, but research on suicide among non-Western peoples is limited. Most notably, few studies analyze suicidality within small scale, non-industrial societies. Using ethnographic data from 53 cultures, this study tests two evolutionary theories of suicidal behavior: (1) deCatanzaro's inclusive fitness model, which proposes that successful suicide would increase the inclusive fitness of individuals with low reproductive potential who are a burden on kin, and (2) the bargaining model, which proposes that suicide attempts are a costly signal of need, with completed suicides an unfortunate byproduct. These models were operationalized into two sets of variables, which were used to code 474 textual accounts of suicide extracted from the Probability Sample of the Human Relations Area Files. Results indicate limited support for the inclusive fitness model, which might apply primarily to older adults in harsh environments, and widespread support for most elements of the bargaining model, especially among younger healthy adolescents and adults.},

  abstract = {Lethal and nonlethal suicidal behaviors are major global public health problems. Much suicidal behavior (SB) occurs after the suicide victim committed a murder or other serious transgression. The present study tested a novel evolutionary model termed the Costly Apology Model (CAM) against the ethnographic record. The bargaining model (BRM) sees nonlethal suicidal behavior as an evolved costly signal of need in the wake of adversity. Relying on this same theoretical framework, the CAM posits that nonlethal suicidal behavior can sometimes serve as an honest signal of apology in the wake of committing a severe transgression, thereby repairing valuable social relationships. To test this hypothesis, the CAM was operationalized into a set of variables, and two independent coders coded 473 text records on suicidal behavior from 53 cultures from the probability sample of the Human Relations Area Files. The results indicated that in ethnographic accounts of suicidal behavior, transgressions, punishment, and shame were relatively common, supporting the CAM, but explicit motives to apologize and evidence of forgiveness were rare, contrary to the CAM. The theoretical variables of the CAM nevertheless formed a cluster distinct from the BRM, and a subset of cases of suicidal behavior were largely related to transgressions and other CAM variables rather than BRM or other variables. Support for the CAM varied widely across cultures, but there was evidence for it in every major geographical region. Exploratory analyses suggested that the CAM is potentially more likely to occur in response to severe conflicts concerning transgressions committed against nonkin. Furthermore, in text records that involved transgressions, male suicidal behavior was most frequently associated with murder, whereas female suicidal behavior was most frequently associated with sexual transgressions. In conclusion, the results provided mixed support for the hypothesis that some instances of suicidal behavior function to send a costly signal of apology to those harmed by a transgression.},

  abstract = {The germ theory of disease and the attendant public health initiatives, including sanitation, vaccination, and antibiotic treatment, led to dramatic increases in global life expectancy. As the prevalence of infectious disease declines, mental disorders are emerging as major contributors to the global burden of disease. Scientists understand little about the etiology of mental disorders, however, and many of the most popular psychopharmacological treatments, such as antidepressants and antipsychotics, have only moderate-to-weak efficacy in treating symptoms and fail to target biological systems that correspond to discrete psychiatric syndromes. Consequently, despite dramatic increases in the treatment of some mental disorders, there has been no decrease in the prevalence of most mental disorders since accurate record keeping began. Many researchers and theorists are therefore endeavoring to rethink psychiatry from the ground-up. Anthropology, especially biological anthropology, can offer critical theoretical and empirical insights to combat mental illness globally. Biological anthropologists are unique in that we take a panhuman approach to human health and behavior and are trained to address each of Tinbergen's four levels of analysis as well as culture. The field is thus exceptionally well-situated to help resolve the mysteries of mental illness by integrating biological, evolutionary, and sociocultural perspectives.},

Recently the emphasis is put on the contribution of the body's inflammatory response as one of the causes of depression. The interactions between nervous and immune systems are the main issue addressed by psychoneuroimmunology. In patients suffering from depression changes in the plasma concentrations of cytokines and in the number and level of activation of immune cells has been found. Attention is paid to the high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, the prevalence of Th1 responses to Th2, weakening of NK cell cytotoxicity and changes in lymphocyte proliferation and apoptosis. A number of studies focus on influence of antidepressants and non-standard methods of depression treatment, such as ketamine infusion, on patients' immunology. Many of them seem to regulate the immune responses. The study results encourage to look for new ways to treat depression with immunomodulatory drugs. In this article authors present the current knowledge about immune system changes accompanying depression as well as the study results showing the influence of drugs on the immune system, especially in the context of reducing the symptoms of depression.},

  abstract = {We test the theory that shame evolved as a defense against being devalued by others. By hypothesis, shame is a neurocomputational program tailored by selection to orchestrate cognition, motivation, physiology, and behavior in the service of: (               i               ) deterring the individual from making choices where the prospective costs of devaluation exceed the benefits, (               ii               ) preventing negative information about the self from reaching others, and (               iii               ) minimizing the adverse effects of devaluation when it occurs. Because the unnecessary activation of a defense is costly, the shame system should estimate the magnitude of the devaluative threat and use those estimates to cost-effectively calibrate its activation: Traits or actions that elicit more negative evaluations from others should elicit more shame. As predicted, shame closely tracks the threat of devaluation in the United States (               r               = .69), India (               r               = .79), and Israel (               r               = .67). Moreover, shame in each country strongly tracks devaluation in the others, suggesting that shame and devaluation are informed by a common species-wide logic of social valuation. The shame\textendash devaluation link is also specific: Sadness and anxiety\textemdash emotions that coactivate with shame\textemdash fail to track devaluation. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first empirical demonstration of a close, specific match between shame and devaluation within and across cultures.},

In response to this puzzle, researchers have proposed that the mind has ecologically rational systems for providing aid. These systems respond to cues that predicted adaptive behavior during human evolution, regardless of whether such cues continue to be predictive in modern environments. In three studies, we test for two cues that might predict whether a potential benefactor will help a potential recipient: the need of the recipient and the extent to which the recipient is willing to sacrifice for the benefactor. Both cues, in ancestral environments, have the potential to predict whether a long-term relationship might be established. Consistent with past research, we find that both cues matter: Needy people and people willing to sacrifice are helped more. However, the cues are not merely additive: In some cases, the cue of need is ignored and only willingness to sacrifice is used. We discuss these results in terms of recent evolutionary theories of emotions.},

  abstract = {Anger appears to be a neurocognitive adaptation designed to bargain for better treatment, and is primarily triggered by indications that another individual values the focal individual insufficiently. Once activated, anger orchestrates cognitive, physiological, and behavioral responses geared to incentivize the target individual to place more weight on the welfare of the focal individual. Here, we evaluate the hypothesis that anger works by matching in intensity the various outputs it controls to the magnitude of the current input\textemdash the precise degree to which the target appears to undervalue the focal individual. By magnitude-matching outputs to inputs, the anger system balances the competing demands of effectiveness and economy and avoids the dual errors of excessive diffidence and excessive belligerence in bargaining. To test this hypothesis, we measured the degree to which audiences devalue each of 39 negative traits in others, and how individuals would react, for each of those 39 traits, if someone slandered them as possessing those traits. We observed the hypothesized magnitude-matchings. The intensities of the anger feeling and of various motivations of anger (telling the offender to stop, insulting the offender, physically attacking the offender, stopping talking to the offender, and denying help to the offender) vary in proportion to: (i) one another, and (ii) the reputational cost that the slanderer imposes on the slandered (proxied by audience devaluation). These patterns of magnitude-matching were observed both within and between the United States and India. These quantitative findings echo laypeople's folk understanding of anger and suggest that there are cross-cultural regularities in the functional logic and content of anger.},

  abstract = {During pregnancy, immune activity is tightly regulated so that antimicrobial protection of the mother and fetus is balanced with the need for immune tolerance to prevent fetal rejection. In this setting, the maternal\textendash fetal interface, in the form of the uterine decidua, provides a heterogeneous immune cell population with the potential to mediate diverse activities throughout pregnancy. Recent studies have suggested that vitamin D may be a key regulator of immune function during pregnancy, with the fetal\textendash maternal interface representing a prominent target. Among its non-classical actions are potent immunomodulatory effects, including induction of antibacterial responses and modulation of T-lymphocytes to suppress inflammation and promote tolerogenesis. Thus, vitamin D may play a pivotal role in normal decidual immune function by promoting innate responses to infection, while simultaneously preventing an over-elaboration of inflammatory adaptive immunity. Research to date has focused upon the potential role of vitamin D in preventing infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, as well as possibly suppressing of autoimmune disease. Nevertheless, vitamin D may also influence facets of immune function not immediately associated with primary innate responses. This review summarises our current understanding of decidual immune function with respect to the vitamin D metabolism and signalling, and as to how this may be affected by variations in maternal vitamin D status. There has recently been much interest in vitamin D supplementation of pregnant women, but our knowledge of how this may influence the function of decidua remains limited. Further insight into the immunomodulatory actions of vitamin D during pregnancy will help shed light upon this.},

Methods Sixteen lifetime SLEs were assessed at interview in two groups of Han Chinese women: 1970 clinically ascertained with recurrent MDD and 2597 matched controls. Diagnostic and other risk factor information was assessed at personal interview. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated by logistic regression. Results 60\% of controls and 72\% of cases reported at least one lifetime SLE. Fourteen of the sixteen SLEs occurred significantly more frequently in those with MDD (median odds ratio of 1.6). The three SLEs most strongly associated with risk for MDD (OR{$>$}3.0) preceded the onset of MDD the majority of the time: rape (82\%), physical abuse (100\%) and serious neglect (99\%). Limitations Our results may apply to females only. SLEs were rated retrospectively and are subject to biases in recollection. We did not assess contextual information for each life event. Conclusions More severe SLEs are more strongly associated with MDD. These results support the involvement of psychosocial adversity in the etiology of MDD in China.},

Design, Patients and Measurements Online databases, including Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science, were searched for observational studies, with at least 100 female participants, reporting associations between endogenous testosterone blood concentrations and muscle mass, strength and performance. The findings were synthesized in a narrative review. Heterogeneity in study design and analysis precluded a meta-analysis. Results Of the 36 articles retrieved for full-text review, 10 met the inclusion criteria. Eight studies were cross-sectional, 1 longitudinal and 1 provided both cross-sectional and longitudinal data. Testosterone was measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in two studies and by immunoassay in 8. An association between total testosterone and muscle mass, strength or performance in women was not found. The studies of calculated free or bioavailable testosterone and lean muscle mass reported a positive association, but no association was reported for muscle strength or performance. Each included study was limited by a high risk of bias in at least one assessed domain. Conclusions This review does not support an association between testosterone and muscle mass, strength or performance in women. This, together with the reported associations between free or bioavailable testosterone and muscle mass should be interpreted cautiously due to the predominant use of immunoassay and the inaccuracy of calculated variables. Additionally, biological significance of nonprotein bound testosterone has not been established.

Chronic inflammation contributes to several of the diseases showing racial disparities (e.g., Human Immunodeficiency Virus [HIV]), and racial differences in stress exposure (e.g., experiences of racial discrimination) that stimulate pro-inflammatory processes that may contribute to differential health outcomes., We performed a cross-sectional bioinformatic analyses relating perceived discrimination (as measured by the Perceived Ethnic Discrimination Questionnaire [PED-Q]) to the activity of pro-inflammatory, neuroendocrine, and antiviral transcription control pathways relevant to the conserved transcriptional response to adversity (CTRA) in peripheral blood leukocytes. Subjects were 71 individuals (37 HIV-seropositive (HIV+); 34 HIV-seronegative (HIV-)) (mean age = 53 years, range 27\textendash 63), who self-identified either as African American/Black (n=48) or European American/White (n=23). This provided the opportunity to examine the independent effects of race and HIV, as well as the modifying role of perceived discrimination on pathways involved in CTRA. Exploratory analysis examined the interactive effects of HIV and race on pathways involved in CTRA. Relative to European Americans, African Americans showed increased activity of two key pro-inflammatory transcription control pathways (NF-\cyrchar\cyrk B and AP-1) and two stress-responsive signaling pathways (CREB and glucocorticoid receptor); these effects did not differ significantly as a function of HIV infection (HIV x Race interaction, all p {$>$} .10). Results suggested that differences in experiences of racial discrimination could potentially account for more than 50\% of the total race-related difference in pro-inflammatory transcription factor activity. In sum, differential exposure to racial discrimination may contribute to racial disparities in health outcomes in part by activating threat-related molecular programs that stimulate inflammation and contribute to increased risk of chronic illnesses.},

  abstract = {Anthropologists are interested in understanding patterns of human variation, whether assessed along cultural, biological, linguistic, or material metrics. Epigenetics, the study of heritable chemical modifications to DNA, is an emerging approach that could enrich modern anthropological research. Epigenetic marks can change in response to many of the processes anthropologists study\textemdash for example, migration, nutritional stress, psychosocial stress, and social inequalities, to name a few. Thus, epigenetic processes could provide a biological explanation for the embodiment of such environmental experiences. Further, given the potential for epigenetic marks to be inherited across generations, it is possible that these marks facilitate intergenerational transmission of environmental information and therefore help to shape the direction of evolutionary change. In this article, we review some of the ways in which epigenetic methods have been successfully incorporated into anthropological and related studies as well as emphasize promising future directions and challenges for the use of epigenetic data across subfields of anthropology. While epigenetic data have great potential for informing anthropological research, we emphasize that a healthy skepticism is necessary given our still-nascent understanding of these processes.

Although the role of care-giving in achieving survival is occasionally acknowledged it is rarely elaborated, and a bioarchaeological model of care is missing. Contextualized analysis of specific instances of care can offer unique insights into contemporary culture, as the case of M9 illustrates. The `bioarchaeology of care' identifies likely functional impacts of the pathology; possible and probable health challenges encountered; and nature of the support required to sustain life. Consideration of these factors in relation to lifeways practices and behaviours extends and enriches archaeological observations of M9's community. Additionally, M9's survival of extreme disability suggests certain personality traits touching on aspects of identity. Still under development, this new methodology promises to be a valuable heuristic tool.},

  abstract = {Indicators of the lived experience of disease are frequently found in archaeologically recovered human remains. Where evidence suggests a period of survival with pathology likely to have compromised an individual's ability to function independently, or to participate appropriately, within their lifeways setting, it can be inferred that this person likely received a level of health-related care to assist them in managing disease impact \textendash{} and the characteristics of this caregiving may offer insights into important aspects of community and culture. The bioarchaeology of care is a recently developed, case study-based approach for identifying and interpreting instances of past disability and associated care responses within the corresponding archaeological context, and it is supported by the Index of Care, an online application designed to assist in working systematically through the four stages of bioarchaeology of care analysis. This chapter is an introduction to bioarchaeology of care theory and practice for readers who are not already familiar with these and serves as background for the following chapters in this volume. Drawing on the examples of two prehistoric individuals (Man Bac Burial 9, from Neolithic Vietnam, and Romito 2, from Epigravettian Italy) thought to have received very different forms of care, the chapter describes the bioarchaeology of care methodology, summarising the principles shaping its design, its scope and its limitations. It outlines both the most commonly voiced objections to the archaeological inference of care and the conceptual foundations on which the new approach was constructed. In closing, the chapter briefly considers why it is important for archaeology to acknowledge the implications of the giving and receipt of care wherever evidence permits \textendash{} in terms of enriching academic knowledge; realising our ethical obligations to the individuals whose remains we analyse and whose lives we (re)produce; and providing a perspective on past life and behaviour that may help inform debate on behaviours in the present.},

  abstract = {Symptoms of illness provide information about an organism's underlying state. This notion has inspired a burgeoning body of research on organisms' adaptations for detecting and changing behavior toward ill individuals. However, little attention has been paid to a likely outcome of these dynamics. Once an organism's fitness is affected by others' responses to symptoms of illness, natural selection can favor individuals who alter symptom expression to influence the behavior of others. That is, many symptoms may originate as cues, but will evolve into signals. In this paper, I develop the hypothesis that symptoms of illness serve signaling functions, and provide a comprehensive review of relevant evidence from diverse disciplines. I also develop novel empirical predictions generated by this hypothesis and discuss its implications for public health. Signaling provides an ultimate explanation for otherwise opaque aspects of symptom expression, such as why symptoms fluctuate in social contexts, and can exist without underlying pathology, and why individuals deliberately generate symptoms of illness. This analysis suggests that signaling theory is a major organizing framework for understanding symptom etiology.},

We show that racial classifications are inadequate descriptors of the distribution of genetic variation in our species. Although populations do cluster by broad geographic regions, which generally correspond to socially recognized races, the distribution of genetic variation is quasicontinuous in clinal patterns related to geography. The broad global pattern reflects the accumulation of genetic drift associated with a recent African origin of modern humans, followed by expansion out of Africa and across the rest of the globe. Because disease genes may be geographically restricted due to mutation, genetic drift, migration and natural selection, knowledge of individual ancestry will be important for biomedical studies. Identifiers based on race will often be insufficient.},

To determine whether this discrepancy is due to the stability of the distribution of PHQ-9 total scores against age, we investigated whether the total score distribution remains stable during adulthood, and also investigated the mathematical patterns of the total score distribution. Methods: The present study utilized data from 15,847 participants of the 2009-2014 United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, all of whom responded to all PHQ-9 items. The stability of the total score distribution among different age groups was examined using overlap coefficients and graphical analysis. Results: High overlap coefficients were observed between all age groups for the distributions of PHQ-9 total scores, suggesting that the distribution of PHQ-9 total scores remains stable against age. Graphical analysis demonstrated that distributions of PHQ-9 total scores were similar across age groups. In addition, distributions of PHQ-9 total scores exhibited an exponential pattern, except at the lower end of the distribution. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that the stability of the distribution of PHQ-9 total scores throughout adulthood may underlie inconsistencies in the evidence regarding age-related changes in total depression scores.},

We observe that they pay a great deal of attention to the victim of pena and that they try to improve relationships with the social network and the family. The indigenous theory on pena also points to the importance of bodily elements closely associated to the psychological conditions.

A major focus in nutrition and reproduction is the health consequences of evolved biology in the context of contemporary diets, lifestyles, and contraceptive practices seen in industrialized nations. Contributions from anthropology include efforts to assess and redefine the concept of ``normal'' in health indicators, emphasis on developmental processes in addition to proximate and ultimate forces affecting health, and enhancement of understanding of contemporary health disparities. Evolutionary medicine is a highly interdisciplinary field, and anthropologists have played important roles in directing attention not only to evolutionary processes but also to sociocultural and sociopolitical effects on human health.}

We aimed to estimate the prevalence and odds of being a victim of domestic violence by diagnostic category and sex. Methods Study design: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data Sources: Eighteen biomedical and social sciences databases (including MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO); journal hand searches; scrutiny of references and citation tracking of included articles; expert recommendations, and an update of a systematic review on victimisation and mental disorder. Inclusion criteria: observational and intervention studies reporting prevalence or odds of being a victim of domestic violence in men and women (aged {$\geq$}16 years), using validated diagnostic measures of mental disorder. Procedure: Data were extracted and study quality independently appraised by two reviewers. Analysis: Random effects meta-analyses were used to pool estimates of prevalence and odds. Results Forty-one studies were included. There is a higher risk of experiencing adult lifetime partner violence among women with depressive disorders (OR 2.77 (95\% CI 1.96\textendash 3.92), anxiety disorders (OR 4.08 (95\% CI 2.39\textendash 6.97), and PTSD (OR 7.34 95\% CI 4.50\textendash 11.98), compared to women without mental disorders. Insufficient data were available to calculate pooled odds for other mental disorders, family violence (i.e. violence perpetrated by a non-partner), or violence experienced by men. Individual studies reported increased odds for women and men for all diagnostic categories, including psychoses, with a higher prevalence reported for women. Few longitudinal studies were found so the direction of causality could not be investigated. Conclusions There is a high prevalence and increased likelihood of being a victim of domestic violence in men and women across all diagnostic categories, compared to people without disorders. Longitudinal studies are needed to identify pathways to being a victim of domestic violence to optimise healthcare responses.},

Investments in a high testosterone phenotype trade-off against other functions, particularly survival-enhancing immune function and cellular repair; thus only individuals in good condition can maintain both a high testosterone phenotype and somatic maintenance. While these effects are observed in experimental manipulations, they are difficult to demonstrate in free-living animals, particularly in humans. We hypothesize that individuals with higher testosterone will have higher energetic expenditures than those with lower testosterone. Methods Total energetic expenditure (TEE) was quantified using doubly labeled water in n = 40 Tsimane forager-horticulturalists (50\% male, 18\textendash 87 years) and n = 11 Hadza hunter-gatherers (100\% male, 18\textendash 65 years), two populations living subsistence lifestyles, high levels of physical activity, and high infectious burden. Urinary testosterone, TEE, body composition, and physical activity were measured to assess potential physical and behavioral costs associated with a high testosterone phenotype. Results Endogenous male testosterone was significantly associated with energetic expenditure, controlling for fat free mass; a one standard deviation increase in testosterone is associated with the expenditure of an additional 96\textendash 240 calories per day. Discussion These results suggest that a high testosterone phenotype, while beneficial for male reproduction, is also energetically expensive and likely only possible to maintain in healthy males in robust condition.},

  abstract = {Objective: Testosterone plays a vital role in brain function and behavior. Among humans, age-related decline in testosterone is associated with declining cognitive functioning, and aging men with higher testosterone maintain better cognitive performance. However, most research focuses on industrialized populations with widespread access to formal schooling, high testosterone, and low parasite and pathogen load. We examine whether men's testosterone is associated with cognitive performance among Tsimane forager-horticulturalists of Bolivia despite relatively lower levels of testosterone and higher immune burden. Methods: Ninety-four Tsimane men aged 36\textendash 86 (median = 49) participated in a cognitive battery (assessing short- and long-term recall, digit span, semantic memory, and visual scan) and provided urine and blood samples to measure testosterone and markers of immune activation. Linear mixed effects regressions were used to model associations between cognitive performance and testosterone, controlling for age, years of schooling, Spanish fluency, and village residence. For a subset (n = 66) we included immune activation markers to examine mediator effects. Results: Testosterone is positively associated with short- and long-term verbal memory ({$\beta$} = 0.267, P = 0.018; {$\beta$} = 0.326, P = 0.005 respectively) and visual scanning ({$\beta$} = 0.306, P = 0.008) after controlling for potential confounders. Markers of immune activation were negatively associated with cognitive function, but did not change the associations between testosterone and cognitive performance. Conclusion: Tsimane men show positive associations between testosterone and cognitive performance, particularly for recall and visual scanning, despite higher immune burden. Testosterone may help motivate both physical and cognitive capacities that were essential for extracting the difficult-to-acquire, high-quality resources upon which humans relied over evolutionary history.},

Studies often find that lower testosterone levels are associated with increased paternal investment, though most studies are conducted under relatively stable ecological conditions. In this paper, we examine parental physiological correlates of crop loss and family health problems among Tsimane forager-horticulturalists following a catastrophic flood in lowland Bolivia. Immediately after a devastating 2014 flood that impacted {$>$}75\% of Tsimane communities, we conducted structured interviews examining crop losses and morbidity, and collected saliva specimens from 421 parents (n\,=\,292 households) to analyze cortisol and testosterone. Over 98\% of interviewees reported horticultural losses, with the average family losing 88\% of their crops, while 80\% of families reported flood-induced injuries or illnesses. Controlling for age, body mass index, and time of specimen collection, men's testosterone was negatively associated with both absolute cropland losses (Std. {$\beta$}\,=\,-0.16, p\,=\,0.037), and percent of cropland lost (Std. {$\beta$}\,=\,-0.16, p\,=\,0.040). Female testosterone was not associated with crop losses. Using the same control variables, both male and female cortisol was negatively associated with a composite measure of child health burden (fathers: Std. {$\beta$}\,=\,-0.34, p\,{$<$}\,0.001; mothers: Std. {$\beta$}\,=\,-0.23, p\,=\,0.037). These results are discussed in the cultural context of a strong sexual division of labor among Tsimane; we highlight the physiological and psychosocial costs of experiencing a natural disaster, especially for paternal caregivers in a nutritionally and pathogenically stressed subsistence population where cultigens provide the majority of calories in the diet.},

Decolonization brings about the repatriation of Indigenous land and life; it is not a metaphor for other things we want to do to improve our societies and schools. The easy adoption of decolonizing discourse by educational advocacy and scholarship, evidenced by the increasing number of calls to ``decolonize our schools,'' or use ``decolonizing methods,'' or, ``decolonize student thinking'', turns decolonization into a metaphor. As important as their goals may be, social justice, critical methodologies, or approaches that decenter settler perspectives have objectives that may be incommensurable with decolonization.~Because settler colonialism is built upon an entangled triad structure of settler-native-slave, the decolonial desires of white, non-white, immigrant, postcolonial, and oppressed people, can similarly be entangled in resettlement, reoccupation, and reinhabitation that actually further settler colonialism. The metaphorization of decolonization makes possible a set of evasions, or ``settler moves to innocence'', that problematically attempt to reconcile settler guilt and complicity, and rescue settler futurity. In this article, we analyze multiple settler moves towards innocence in order to forward ``an ethic of incommensurability'' that recognizes what is distinct and what is sovereign for project(s) of decolonization in relation to human and civil rights based social justice projects. We also point to unsettling themes within transnational/Third World decolonizations, abolition, and critical space-place pedagogies, which challenge the coalescence of social justice endeavors, making room for more meaningful potential alliances.},

The evolutionary framework of multilevel selection suggests that complex hierarchies can arise in response to selection imposed by intergroup conflict (warfare).

As such, understanding patterns of recreational and medical cannabis use is a high public health priority. Objectives Patterns of cannabis use (recreational and medical), other substance use, and psychiatric symptoms were characterized in a large sample of community adult cannabis users in Canada, prior to federal cannabis legalization. Methods This was a self-report assessment of 709 cannabis users (Mean age~=~30.19 (11.82) years; 55.01\% female). Patterns of overall substance use and psychiatric symptomatology were compared based on recreational/medical cannabis status. Results Overall, 61.4\% of participants endorsed exclusively recreational use, while 38.6\% reported some level of medical use. Of all medical users, only 23.4\% reported authorization from a health professional. Recreational cannabis users typically reported infrequent use (less than weekly), whereas medical users modally reported daily use. Compared to recreational users, medical users reported more problematic cannabis use in addition to greater psychiatric symptomatology (anxiety, depression and trauma). Interestingly, a large majority of medical users also reported using recreationally (80.6\%), while exclusive medical use was less common (19.3\%). This dual motives group reported more daily cannabis use and more alcohol and tobacco use. Compared to medical-only users, individuals using cannabis for both medical and recreational purposes more often used cannabis to treat psychiatric conditions. Conclusions These findings reveal the differences in cannabis use patterns and preferences between recreational and medical users, and even within medical users. In particular, dual motives individuals, who use cannabis for both positively and negatively reinforcing purposes, may warrant special attention as a subpopulation.},

  abstract = {Background Valid assessment of drug efficacy and safety requires an evidence base free of reporting bias. Using trial reports in Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug approval packages as a gold standard, we previously found that the published literature inflated the apparent efficacy of antidepressant drugs. The objective of the current study was to determine whether this has improved with recently approved drugs. Methods and findings Using medical and statistical reviews in FDA drug approval packages, we identified 30 Phase II/III double-blind placebo-controlled acute monotherapy trials, involving 13,747 patients, of desvenlafaxine, vilazodone, levomilnacipran, and vortioxetine; we then identified corresponding published reports. We compared the data from this newer cohort of antidepressants (approved February 2008 to September 2013) with the previously published dataset on 74 trials of 12 older antidepressants (approved December 1987 to August 2002). Using logistic regression, we examined the effects of trial outcome and trial cohort (newer versus older) on transparent reporting (whether published and FDA conclusions agreed). Among newer antidepressants, transparent publication occurred more with positive (15/15 = 100\%) than negative (7/15 = 47\%) trials (OR 35.1, CI95\% 1.8 to 693). Controlling for trial outcome, transparent publication occurred more with newer than older trials (OR 6.6, CI95\% 1.6 to 26.4). Within negative trials, transparent reporting increased from 11\% to 47\%. We also conducted and contrasted FDA- and journal-based meta-analyses. For newer antidepressants, FDA-based effect size (ESFDA) was 0.24 (CI95\% 0.18 to 0.30), while journal-based effect size (ESJournals) was 0.29 (CI95\% 0.23 to 0.36). Thus, effect size inflation, presumably due to reporting bias, was 0.05, less than for older antidepressants (0.10). Limitations of this study include a small number of trials and drugs\textemdash belonging to a single class\textemdash and a focus on efficacy (versus safety). Conclusions Reporting bias persists but appears to have diminished for newer, compared to older, antidepressants. Continued efforts are needed to further improve transparency in the scientific literature.},

The first, which is an intragroup account, holds that these relationships between pathogens and politics are based on motivations to adhere to local norms, which are sometimes shaped by cultural evolution to have pathogen-neutralizing properties. The second, which is an intergroup account, holds that these same relationships are based on motivations to avoid contact with outgroups, who might pose greater infectious disease threats than ingroup members. Results from a study surveying 11,501 participants across 30 nations are more consistent with the intragroup account than with the intergroup account. National parasite stress relates to traditionalism (an aspect of conservatism especially related to adherence to group norms) but not to social dominance orientation (SDO; an aspect of conservatism especially related to endorsements of intergroup barriers and negativity toward ethnic and racial outgroups). Further, individual differences in pathogen-avoidance motives (i.e., disgust sensitivity) relate more strongly to traditionalism than to SDO within the 30 nations.},

Applications of biologically derived foraging models have typically taken this technology as a given when analyzing ethnographic and prehistoric subsistence practices. This paper departs from the standard approach by treating investment in technology as a decision variable and looking at how investment decisions might be expected to vary with changes in both the time available to forage and the nature of the local resource base. The study draws attention to the importance of understanding both the costs and the benefits of technological investment and how they relate to one another. We use ethnographic and hypothetical data to demonstrate how one might represent these relationships mathematically, discuss the importance for understanding investment decisions, and explore their implications in circumstances where resources are randomly and non-randomly encountered.},

With reference to the Kleinman explanatory model of illness, their beliefs about postpartum depression and its treatment were contrasted to the biomedical model of postpartum depression. Methods: Content analysis was done to classify data into cause, effect, severity, expectations, fears, and suggestions for treatment. Results were compared with DSM-IV diagnostic criteria. Results: Postpartum depressed mothers' explanatory model of depression differed from the DSM-IV criteria for depression in that mothers' depiction was generally milder in form and consisted of sleep deprivation instead of sleep disorders. Also, mothers were confused, overwhelmed, and guilty about thoughts of hurting their babies. The mothers did not exhibit suicidal ideation. Mothers described the illness as severe and long lasting, causing multiple problems including marital discord. Implications: Mothers suggested more public education and support for new mothers to prevent and treat the disorder.},

Uhlen et al. performed a global expression analysis of human blood cell types and integrated this data with data across all major human tissues and organs in the human protein atlas. This comprehensive compendium allows for classification of all human protein-coding genes with regard to their tissue- and cell-type distribution. Science, this issue p. eaax9198 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONBlood is the predominant source for molecular analyses in humans, both in clinical and research settings, and is the target for many therapeutic strategies, emphasizing the need for comprehensive molecular maps of the cells constituting human blood. The Human Protein Atlas program (www.proteinatlas.org) is an open-access database that aims to map all human proteins by integrating various omics technologies, including antibody-based imaging. Previously, the Human Protein Atlas included gene expression information from peripheral blood mononuclear cells but not the many subpopulations of blood cells within this cell type. To increase the resolution, we performed an in-depth characterization of the constituent cells in blood to provide a detailed view of the gene expression in individual human blood cells and relate these to the other tissues in the body. RATIONALEA quantitative transcriptomics-based expression analysis was performed in 18 canonical immune cell populations (Fig. 1) isolated by flow cytometric sorting. The blood cell expression profiles are presented in combination with expression profiles of tissues, including transcriptomics data from external sources to expand the number of tissue types as well as brain regions included in the database. A genome-wide classification of the protein-coding genes has been performed in terms of expression specificity and distribution, both in blood cells and tissues. RESULTSWe present an atlas of the expression of all protein-coding genes in human blood cells, integrated with a classification of the specificity and distribution of all protein-coding genes in all major tissues and organs in the human body. A genome-wide analysis of blood cell RNA expression profiles allowed the identification of genes with elevated expression in various immune cells, confirming well-known protein markers, but also identified novel targets for in-depth analysis. There are 1448 protein-coding genes that have enriched expression in a single immune cell type. It will be interesting to study the corresponding proteins further to explore the biological functions linked to the respective cell phenotypes. A network plot of all cell type\textendash enriched and group-enriched genes (Fig. 1B) reveals that many of the cell type\textendash enriched genes are in neutrophils, eosinophils, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, while many of the elevated genes in T and B cells are group-enriched across subpopulations of these lymphocytes. To illustrate the usefulness of this resource, we show the cellular distribution of genes known to cause primary immunodeficiencies in humans and find that many of these genes are expressed in cells not currently implicated in these diseases, illustrating how this global atlas can help us better understand the function of specific genes across cells and tissues in humans. CONCLUSIONIn this study, we have performed a genome-wide transcriptomic analysis of protein-coding genes in sorted blood immune cell populations to characterize the expression levels of each individual gene across all cell types. All data are presented in an interactive, open-access Blood Atlas as part of the Human Protein Atlas and are integrated with expression profiles across all major tissues to provide spatial classification of all protein-coding genes. This allows for a genome-wide exploration of the expression profiles across human immune cell populations and all major human tissues and organs. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/366/6472/eaax9198/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Fig. 1 Outline of the analysis of human single blood cell types.(A) A schematic view of the hematopoietic differentiation.

We argue in this chapter that binge eating and disinhibition are evolved mechanisms for dealing with one of the most fundamental of insecurities, that of food, especially in seasonal and unpredictable environments. It is only in recent decades in industrialized nations, with improved food security and the emergence of obesity at the population level, that such mechanisms have become detrimental in terms of health outcomes and have been medically pathologized. Binge eating and disinhibition are no longer responses to uncertainty in food availability as they would have been across evolutionary history, or in parts of the world where there continues to be food insecurity. Rather, there may be other types of uncertainty and insecurity that lead to disinhibited eating and binge eating as evolutionarily based responses to stress which can lead to obesity, and there is scope for clinical practice to give greater emphasis to such responses as higher-level factors that structure health and illness. These would include stress-inducing factors at work and in everyday life.},

However, people seem to process positive and negative information differentially, described in the literature as instances of negativity bias, positivity bias, or valence asymmetries. We provide an overview of these processing differences and their explanations. First, we review negativity advantages: People attend more to negative information, recall it more, and weigh it more heavily, relative to positive information. Second, we review positivity advantages: People process positive information faster, have broader associations from it, and show stronger congruency effects, relative to negative information. We then discuss existing explanations for these differential effects in terms of phylogenetic pressures, correlates of valence, diagnosticity, mobilization-minimization, and top-down vs. bottom-up processing. Finally, we suggest the differential similarity of positive and negative information as a unifying explanation. We delineate why positive information should be more alike relative to negative information, and how differential similarity translates to the observed processing differences. Then we show how the similarity explanation leads to novel predictions and how it solves old puzzles. Similarity thereby provides an explanatory construct for both positivity and negativity advantages, allowing precise quantitative predictions for valence asymmetries beyond the mere classification of ``good'' and ``bad.''},

  abstract = {Immune function is an energetically costly physiological activity that potentially diverts calories away from less immediately essential life tasks. Among developing organisms, the allocation of energy toward immune function may lead to tradeoffs with physical growth, particularly in high-pathogen, low-resource environments. The present study tests this hypothesis across diverse timeframes, branches of immunity, and conditions of energy availability among humans. Using a prospective mixed-longitudinal design, we collected anthropometric and blood immune biomarker data from 261 Amazonian forager-horticulturalist Shuar children (age 4\textendash 11 y old). This strategy provided baseline measures of participant stature, s.c. body fat, and humoral and cell-mediated immune activity as well as subsample longitudinal measures of linear growth (1 wk, 3 mo, 20 mo) and acute inflammation. Multilevel analyses demonstrate consistent negative effects of immune function on growth, with children experiencing up to 49\% growth reduction during periods of mildly elevated immune activity. The direct energetic nature of these relationships is indicated by (               i               ) the manifestation of biomarker-specific negative immune effects only when examining growth over timeframes capturing active competition for energetic resources, (               ii               ) the exaggerated impact of particularly costly inflammation on growth, and (               iii               ) the ability of children with greater levels of body fat (i.e., energy reserves) to completely avoid the growth-inhibiting effects of acute inflammation. These findings provide evidence for immunologically and temporally diverse body fat-dependent tradeoffs between immune function and growth during childhood. We discuss the implications of this work for understanding human developmental energetics and the biological mechanisms regulating variation in human ontogeny, life history, and health.},

Electronic medical record data were pooled for all patients who received the IPV screener January 1 to December 31, 2014.Results: Overall, 3.6\% of the sample reported experiencing physical or sexual IPV in the past year. Compared to cisgender women (past-year prevalence 2.7\%), all TGNC subgroups reported elevated odds of physical or sexual IPV, including transgender women (past-year prevalence 12.1\%; adjusted odds ratio [AOR]\,=\,5.0, 95\% confidence interval [CI]\,=\,2.9\textendash 8.6), transgender men (6.6\%; AOR\,=\,2.4, 95\% CI: 1.2\textendash 4.6), gender non-binary individuals (8.2\%, AOR\,=\,3.1, 95\% CI\,=\,1.7\textendash 5.4), and TGNC individuals who did not report their gender identity (9.1\%; AOR\,=\,3.7, 95\% CI\,=\,2.2\textendash 6.3). The prevalence of isolation-related IPV and controlling behaviors was also high in some TGNC groups.Conclusion: Our findings support that IPV is prevalent across genders and sexual orientations. Clinical guidelines for IPV screening should be expanded to include TGNC individuals and not just cisgender women. Future research could explore the complex patterns by which individuals of different genders are at increased risk for different types of IPV, and investigate the best ways to screen TGNC patients and support TGNC survivors.}

Four key domains are discussed: adult\textendash infant interactions, sexual desire, sexual behavior, and partnering.

Humans are discussed within a comparative framework that attends to crossspecies principles informed by human insights alongside human-specific particularities like social constructions, which are critical to evolutionary understandings of the social role of T.

  abstract = {One of the most consistent findings in the social epidemiology of mental health is the gender gap in depression. Depression is approximately twice as prevalent among women as it is among men. However, the absence of comparable data hampers cross-national comparisons of the prevalence of depression in general populations. Using information about the frequency and severity of depressive symptoms from the third wave of the European Social Survey (ESS-3), we are able to fill the gap the absence of comparable data leaves. In the ESS-3, depression is measured with an eight-item version of the Center for Epidemiological Studies\textendash Depression Scale. In the current study, we examine depression among men and women aged 18\textendash 75 in 23 European countries. Our results indicate that women report higher levels of depression than men do in all countries, but there is significant cross-national variation in this gender gap. Gender differences in depression are largest in some of the Eastern and Southern European countries and smallest in Ireland, Slovakia and some Nordic countries. Hierarchical linear models show that socioeconomic as well as family-related factors moderate the relationship between gender and depression. Lower risk of depression is associated in both genders with marriage and cohabiting with a partner as well as with having a generally good socioeconomic position. In a majority of countries, socioeconomic factors have the strongest association with depression in both men and women. This research contributes new findings, expanding the small existing body of literature that presents highly comparable data on the prevalence of depression in women and men in Europe.},

We tested the association between basal and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory markers with individual MDD symptoms (measured using the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology Self-Report) over a period of up to 9 years using multivariate-adjusted mixed models in 1147\textendash 2872 Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) participants. At baseline, participants were on average 42.2 years old, 66.5\% were women and 53.9\% had a current mood or anxiety disorder. We found that basal and LPS-stimulated inflammatory markers were more strongly associated with sickness behavior symptoms at up to 9-year follow-up compared with non-sickness behavior symptoms of depression. However, we also found significant associations with some symptoms that are not typical of sickness behavior (e.g., sympathetic arousal among others). Inflammation was not related to depression as a unified syndrome but rather to the presence and the course of specific MDD symptoms, of which the majority were related to sickness behavior. Anti-inflammatory strategies should be tested in the subgroup of MDD patients who report depressive symptoms related to sickness behavior.},

  abstract = {Results of a cross-cultural study of adult crying across 37 countries are presented. Analyses focused on country differences in recency of last crying episode and crying proneness and relationships with country characteristics. Three hypotheses on the nature of country differences in crying were evaluated: (a) distress due to exposure to taxing conditions, (b) norms regarding emotional expressiveness, and (c) personality (at country level). Individuals living in more affluent, democratic, extraverted, and individualistic countries tend to report to cry more often. These indicators relate to freedom of expression rather than to suffering; therefore, our data provide support for a model that views country differences in crying as being connected with country differences in expressiveness and personality rather than in distress. Gender differences in crying proneness were larger in wealthier, more democratic, and feminine countries. Differences in the meaning of crying at individual level (usually viewed as a sign of distress) and country level (as a sign of expressiveness and personality) are discussed.},

To address this question, I draw on research on the interpersonal effects of emotions on behavior in personal relationships, parent\textendash child interactions, conflict, negotiation, and leadership, and propose a new framework that can account for existing findings and guide future research: the emotions as social information (EASI) model. I demonstrate that emotional expressions affect observers' behavior by triggering inferential processes and/or affective reactions in them. The predictive strength of these two processes\textemdash which may inspire different behaviors\textemdash depends on the observer's information processing and on social-relational factors. Examples of moderators that determine the relative predictive strength of inferences and affective reactions include power, need for cognitive closure, time pressure, display rules, and the appropriateness and target of the emotional expression, which are all discussed.},

  abstract = {Social decisions are heavily influenced by emotion. For decades, the dominant research paradigm has been characterized by a focus on the decision maker's own positive or negative mood. We argue that a full understanding of the role of emotion in social decision making requires a complementary focus on interpersonal effects (i.e., the effects of one individual's emotions on the other's behavior); a focus on discrete emotions rather than general mood states; and a distinction between cooperative and competitive settings. To advance insight into these issues, we present the Emotions as Social Information (EASI) model. The model is grounded in two basic assumptions, namely that individuals use others' emotions to make sense of ambiguous situations, and that the effects of others' emotions and the processes that drive them depend critically on the cooperative or competitive nature of the situation. A review of recent research supports our analysis. We demonstrate that the interpersonal effects of emotions are pervasive and can be better understood in terms of the unique social functions of each emotion than in terms of valence. Effects in cooperative settings are best explained in terms of affective reactions (i.e., emotional contagion, affect infusion, and mood management), whereas effects in competitive contexts are better understood in terms of the strategic inferences individuals draw from other's emotions. We conclude by discussing the implications of our model and highlighting avenues for future research.},

  abstract = {Background: Cannabis use among pregnant and lactating people is increasing, despite clinical evidence showing that cannabis use may be associated with low birth weight and childhood developmental deficits. Our objective was to understand why pregnant and lactating people use cannabis and how these motivations change across perinatal stages. Methods: Using qualitative, constructivist grounded theory methodology, we conducted telephone and virtual interviews with 52 individuals from across Canada. We selected participants using maximum variation and theoretical sampling. They were eligible if they had been pregnant or lactating within the past year and had decided to continue, cease or decrease their cannabis use during the perinatal period. Results: We identified 3 categories of reasons that people use cannabis during pregnancy and lactation: sensation-seeking for fun and enjoyment; symptom management of chronic conditions and conditions related to pregnancy; and coping with the unpleasant, but nonpathologized, experiences of life. Before pregnancy, participants endorsed reasons for using cannabis in these 3 categories in similar proportions, with many offering multiple reasons for use. During pregnancy, reasons for use shifted primarily to symptom management. During lactation, reasons returned to resemble those expressed before pregnancy. Interpretation: In this study, we showed that pregnant and lactating people use cannabis for many reasons, particularly for symptom management. Reasons for cannabis use changed across reproductive stages. The dynamic nature of the reasons for use across stages speaks to participant perception of benefits and risks, and perhaps a desire to cast cannabis use during pregnancy as therapeutic because of perceived stigma.},

We used data collected by the `FRA Violence Against Women Survey' in 2012, and we identified three dimensions of self-reported IPV: IPV via controlling behaviour, psychological IPV, and physical IPV. Based on logistic multilevel estimates of approximately 21,000 women in 27 European countries, we found that women, who were higher educated or earned more than their partners, were more likely to report all three types of IPV. We tested the impact of the societal context by looking at gender ideology, crime rates and the acceptance of domestic violence within a country. Our results suggest that only the level of crime directly impacts IPV, albeit only through controlling behaviour and psychological forms. Furthermore, none of the contextual characteristics moderate the relationship between status mismatch and IPV. Therefore, at least in our sample of European countries, the individual-level factors seem to weigh more than the societal context.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The processes underwriting the acquisition of culture remain unclear. How are shared habits, norms, and expectations learned and maintained with precision and reliability across large-scale sociocultural ensembles? Is there a unifying account of the mechanisms involved in the acquisition of culture? Notions such as ``shared expectations,'' the ``selective patterning of attention and behaviour,'' ``cultural evolution,'' ``cultural inheritance,'' and ``implicit learning'' are the main candidates to underpin a unifying account of cognition and the acquisition of culture; however, their interactions require greater specification and clarification. In this article, we integrate these candidates using the variational (free-energy) approach to human cognition and culture in theoretical neuroscience. We describe the construction by humans of social niches that afford epistemic resources called cultural affordances. We argue that human agents learn the shared habits, norms, and expectations of their culture through immersive participation in patterned cultural practices that selectively pattern attention and behaviour. We call this process ``thinking through other minds'' (TTOM) \textendash{} in effect, the process of inferring other agents' expectations about the world and how to behave in social context. We argue that for humans, information from and about other people's expectations constitutes the primary domain of statistical regularities that humans leverage to predict and organize behaviour. The integrative model we offer has implications that can advance theories of cognition, enculturation, adaptation, and psychopathology. Crucially, this formal (variational) treatment seeks to resolve key debates in current cognitive science, such as the distinction between internalist and externalist accounts of theory of mind abilities and the more fundamental distinction between dynamical and representational accounts of enactivism.},

  abstract = {Cannabis use among pregnant and parenting women is increasing in the USA, alongside escalating THC potency in available cannabis products and the use of synthetic preparations. Existing information on how cannabis use during pregnancy may impact the course of pregnancy and fetal/child development is limited, and studies that evaluate birth outcomes and postnatal development of prenatally exposed children are inconsistent. However, accumulating neurodevelopmental data in animals and humans shows that pre- and postnatal cannabis exposure portends harm for the developing fetus and the child. THC crosses the placental barrier, and current evidence indicates that prenatal cannabis use, especially during critical periods of brain development, places the developing child at risk for neuropsychiatric, behavioral, and substance abuse problems. The extensive legalization of cannabis, the recent increase in marijuana use by pregnant women, the availability of cannabis with higher THC concentrations, and the introduction and escalating use of synthetic cannabinoids create an urgent need to determine the effects of the amplified fetal THC exposure. The risk of neurodevelopmental problems in THC-exposed children may be enhanced if the child is raised by a mother affected by neurobehavioral dysfunctions and associated comorbidities of an active cannabis use disorder. Identification and treatment of cannabis use and cannabis use disorder in women during the perinatal period should be a high clinical priority. Misperception of risk, inadequacy of provider knowledge and training, and scarcity of time and resources to comprehensively address the needs of cannabis-exposed mother-child dyads are common among health providers. Although more research is needed to establish the perinatal effects of maternal cannabis use, pregnant and postpartum women should be aware that perinatal cannabis use risks safety for both mother and child. This chapter provides an overview of the epidemiology of perinatal cannabis use, the neurobehavioral effects of prenatal cannabis exposure for the developing child, and the treatment strategies for the mother-child dyad affected by cannabis use.},

While they often give similar results, there can be striking differences in estimating the effects of covariates. We explain when and why such differences occur. The variance of a quasi-Poisson model is a linear function of the mean while the variance of a negative binomial model is a quadratic function of the mean. These variance relationships affect the weights in the iteratively weighted least-squares algorithm of fitting models to data. Because the variance is a function of the mean, large and small counts get weighted differently in quasi-Poisson and negative binomial regression. We provide an example using harbor seal counts from aerial surveys. These counts are affected by date, time of day, and time relative to low tide. We present results on a data set that showed a dramatic difference on estimating abundance of harbor seals when using quasiPoisson vs. negative binomial regression. This difference is described and explained in light of the different weighting used in each regression method. A general understanding of weighting can help ecologists choose between these two methods.},

Therefore, the objective of our study was to prospectively evaluate sex differences in frailty, assessed by the Multidimensional Prognostic Index (MPI) and mortality, institutionalization, and re-hospitalization in an international cohort of older people admitted to hospital. Study design: We used data from nine public hospitals in Europe and Australia, to evaluate sex differences in mortality, frailty and the risk of institutionalization and re-hospitalization, during one year of follow-up. Main outcome measures: People aged 65 years or more admitted to hospital for an acute medical condition or for a relapse of a chronic disease were included. A standardized comprehensive geriatric assessment, which evaluated functional, nutritional, and cognitive status, risk of pressure sores, comorbidities, medications and cohabitation status, was used to calculate the MPI to measure frailty in all hospitalized older people. Data regarding mortality, institutionalization and re-hospitalization were also recorded for one year. Results: Altogether, 1140 hospitalized patients (mean age = 84.2 years; 694 women = 60.9\%) were included. The one-year mortality rate was 33.2\%. In multivariate analysis, adjusted for age, MPI score, centre and diagnosis at baseline, although women had higher MPI scores than men, the latter had higher in-hospital (odds ratio, OR = 2.26; 95\% confidence intervals, CI = 1.27\textendash 4.01) and one-year post-discharge mortality (OR = 2.04; 95\%CI = 1.50\textendash 2.79). Furthermore, men were less frequently institutionalized in a care home than female patients (OR = 0.55; 95\%CI: 0.34\textendash 0.91), but they were also more frequently re-hospitalized (OR = 1.42; 95\%CI: 1.06\textendash 1.91) during the year after hospital discharge. Conclusion: Older hospitalized men were less frail, but experienced higher in-hospital and one-year mortality than women. Women were admitted more frequently to nursing homes and experienced a lower risk of rehospitalization. These findings suggest important differences between the sexes and extends the `male-female health-survival paradox' to acutely ill patient groups.},

Using published data, we estimate the disease burden for mental illness to show that the global burden of mental illness accounts for 32{$\cdot$}4\% of years lived with disability (YLDs) and 13{$\cdot$}0\% of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), instead of the earlier estimates suggesting 21{$\cdot$}2\% of YLDs and 7{$\cdot$}1\% of DALYs. Currently used approaches underestimate the burden of mental illness by more than a third. Our estimates place mental illness a distant first in global burden of disease in terms of YLDs, and level with cardiovascular and circulatory diseases in terms of DALYs. The unacceptable apathy of governments and funders of global health must be overcome to mitigate the human, social, and economic costs of mental illness.},

  abstract = {Muscular strength, an important component of physical fitness, has an independent role in the prevention of chronic diseases whereas muscular weakness is strongly related to functional limitations and physical disability. Our purpose was to investigate the role of muscular strength as a predictor of mortality in health and disease. We conducted a systematic search in EMBASE and MEDLINE (1980\textendash 2014) looking for the association between muscular strength and mortality risk (all-cause and cause-specific mortality). Selected publications included 23 papers (15 epidemiological and 8 clinical studies). Muscular strength was inversely and independently associated with all-cause mortality even after adjusting for several confounders including the levels of physical activity or even cardiorespiratory fitness. The same pattern was observed for cardiovascular mortality; however more research is needed due to the few available data. The existed studies failed to show that low muscular strength is predictive of cancer mortality. Furthermore, a strong and inverse association of muscular strength with all-cause mortality has also been confirmed in several clinical populations such as cardiovascular disease, peripheral artery disease, cancer, renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, rheumatoid arthritis and patients with critical illness. However, future studies are needed to further establish the current evidence and to explore the exact independent mechanisms of muscular strength in relation to mortality. Muscular strength as a modifiable risk factor would be of great interest from a public health perspective.},

Men who are more likely to win a dyadic physical confrontation, i.e. dominant men, have higher intra-marital fertility for their age, and men with more community-wide influence, i.e. prestigious men, exhibit both higher intra-marital fertility and lower offspring mortality. Both forms of status elicit support from allies and deference from competitors, but high status men are not provisioned more than their peers. Prestigious but not dominant men marry wives who first give birth at earlier ages, which multivariate analysis suggests is the strongest pathway between status and fitness in this population. Furthermore, men are motivated to pursue status because of fitness gains both within and outside of marital unions: dominant and prestigious men have more in-pair surviving offspring as well as more extra-marital affairs.},

Among Tsimane' forager-horticulturalists of Bolivia, we (1) assess traits of elected leaders under experimental and naturalistic conditions and (2) test whether leaders impact collective action outcomes. We find that elected leaders are physically strong and have more kin and other exchange partners. Their ranks on physical dominance, kin support, and trustworthiness predict how well their groups perform, but only where group members have a history of collaborative interaction. Leaders do not take more of the spoils. We discuss why physically strong leaders can be compatible with egalitarianism, and we suggest that leaders in egalitarian societies may be more motivated by maintaining an altruistic reputation than by short-term rewards of collective action.},

We investigate adaptively patterned personality variation among Tsimane' forager-horticulturalists. Based on a consideration of cost-benefit tradeoffs that likely maintain variation in human prosociality, we hypothesize that individual differences in prosocial personality traits are facultatively calibrated to variation in ``embodied capital''\textemdash that is, knowledge, skills, or somatic traits that increase expected future fitness. In support of this hypothesis, 2 components of embodied capital\textemdash physical strength and formal education\textemdash associated positively with Tsimane' prosocial leadership orientation (PLO), a broad personality dimension representing gregarious cooperation, interpersonal warmth, and pursuit of leadership. Moreover, using pedigrees to compute heritability estimates, strength and education had additive effects on the heritable variance in PLO, which suggests that prosocial traits may be ``reactively heritable'' by virtue of their calibration to condition-dependent components of embodied capital. Although alternative explanations must be falsified in future research, our findings 1) provide one of the first demonstrations of adaptively patterned personality variation in a small-scale society and 2) illustrate the potential power of an adaptationist approach to elucidate the causal underpinnings of heritable personality variation.},

  abstract = {Social status motivates much of human behavior. However, status may have been a relatively weak target of selection for much of human evolution if ancestral foragers tended to be more egalitarian. We test the ``egalitarianism hypothesis'' that status has a significantly smaller effect on reproductive success (RS) in foragers compared with nonforagers. We also test between alternative male reproductive strategies, in particular whether reproductive benefits of status are due to lower offspring mortality (parental investment) or increased fertility (mating effort). We performed a phylogenetic multilevel metaanalysis of 288 statistical associations between measures of male status (physical formidability, hunting ability, material wealth, political influence) and RS (mating success, wife quality, fertility, offspring mortality, and number of surviving offspring) from 46 studies in 33 nonindustrial societies. We found a significant overall effect of status on RS (               r               = 0.19), though this effect was significantly lower than for nonhuman primates (               r               = 0.80). There was substantial variation due to marriage system and measure of RS, in particular status associated with offspring mortality only in polygynous societies (               r               = -0.08), and with wife quality only in monogamous societies (               r               = 0.15). However, the effects of status on RS did not differ significantly by status measure or subsistence type: foraging, horticulture, pastoralism, and agriculture. These results suggest that traits that facilitate status acquisition were not subject to substantially greater selection with domestication of plants and animals, and are part of reproductive strategies that enhance fertility more than offspring well-being.},

Independent of these effects, we show that (i) higher-status individuals gain more cooperation partners, and (ii) individuals gain status by cooperating with individuals of higher status than themselves. We posit that human hierarchies are more egalitarian relative to other primates species, owing in part to greater interdependence between cooperation and status hierarchy.},

Results Positive relationships between PHQ-9 total, somatic, and cognitive-affective scores and HOMA score were detected (ps {$<$}0.001). In a simultaneous model, the somatic (p=0.017), but not the cognitive-affective (p=0.071), score remained associated with HOMA score. We observed evidence of (a) moderation by race/ethnicity (relationships stronger in non-Hispanic Whites) and (b) mediation by body mass and inflammation.

The HD analysis is defended here against these and other objections and compared with the Roschian account.

In the strong social networks of Los Duplex, eating traditional Mexican foods, using home remedies, gardening and performing other physical activities, and keeping control over their emotions all help keep migrants healthy.

  abstract = {Objective: Retrospective symptom reports are an important source of information in both laboratory and clinical settings. The present study investigated memory for experimentally induced pain and dyspnea in high and low habitual symptom reporters (HSR). Methods: Healthy women (N=48; 24 high/24 low HSR) participated in two laboratory studies. One study included two pain episodes (cold pressor task), the other study included two dyspnea episodes (rebreathing task). Pain and dyspnea ratings were collected (1) continuously during symptom inductions, (2) after each trial, (3) immediately after the experiment, and (4) at 2-week follow up. Symptom ratings, negative affect (NA) and anxiety measures were also completed following each trial. Results: While the retrospective pain ratings were higher in the high compared with the low HSR group (p = .01), both groups rated recalled dyspnea higher relative to concurrent dyspnea (p {$<$} .001). A further increase in bias over time was only found for dyspnea in high HSR (p = .02). Moreover, dyspnea induction was associated with higher state NA (p = .03) and anxiety (p = .007) than pain induction. Conclusions: Our findings show that even though memory for pain and dyspnea is overall distorted, the extent of bias in symptom recall clearly differs between symptoms and groups. The observed increase of dyspnea reporting over time may have important implications for diagnostic assessment based on symptom reporting.},

However, to understand cultural evolution in the long term, we must have a thorough grounding in cultural evolutionary process on microevolutionary scales. Cultural microevolution is a complex process beginning with the creation of cultural variation by means of error, purposeful innovation, and directed modification. It exists on multiple scales and evolves via processes of cultural transmission, natural and cultural selection, and neutral and nearly neutral process. Scholars study microevolutionary process through simulation models, experiments, ethnographic research, and archaeological data collection and analysis.},

Among Tibetan plateau peoples, these include increased vasodilation and uncoupling of erythropoiesis from hypoxia. Objective/Methods We tested the hypothesis that these high-altitude adaptations reduce risk for hypertension and diabetes-associated anemia among the Mosuo, a Tibetan-descended population in the mountains of Southwest China that is experiencing rapid economic change and increased chronic disease risk. Results Hypertension was substantially less common among Mosuo than low-altitude Han populations, and models fit to the Han predicted higher probability of hypertension than models fit to the Mosuo. Diabetes was positively associated with anemia among the Han, but not the Mosuo. Conclusion The Mosuo have lower risk for hypertension and diabetes-associated anemia than the Han, supporting the hypothesis that high-altitude adaptations affecting blood and circulation intersect with chronic disease processes to lower risk for these outcomes. As chronic diseases continue to grow as global health concerns, it is important to investigate how they may be affected by local genetic adaptations.},

From prenatal exposure to unintentional childhood exposures, through concerns of adolescence abuse and marijuana use for medicinal indications in children, marijuana exposure can affect pediatric patients at every stage in childhood. Regardless of the stage or reason of exposure, concerns exist about short-term and long-term consequences in a child's physical and mental health. The use of cannabidiol (CBD) may have some benefit for the treatment of epilepsy, but emphasis needs to be on rigorous clinical trials to evaluate efficacy and safety. As more states allow both medical and recreational marijuana, availability and prevalence of use will likely increase and more surveillance and research is needed to evaluate the consequences on the pediatric population.},

Yet, research on this phenomenon is hampered by fragmentary statistical data and the sheer contentiousness of this issue. This paper presents the preliminary findings of a research project on workplace suicides in France, where there has been a `suicide epidemic' across a wide range of companies. I draw on an analysis of suicide letters linked to 23 suicide cases across three French companies during the period 2005\textendash 2015. My methodological approach is informed by the work of suicide sociologist, Jack D Douglas, who emphasised the importance of narrative, testimony and voice to our understanding of the causes of suicide. Douglas argued that an analysis of the `social meanings' of suicide should start with a consideration of the motivations attributed to self-killing by suicidal individuals themselves and those close to them. Why does work or conditions of work push some individuals to take their own lives? What can the `suicide voices' articulated in recent testimonies tell us about the causes of workplace suicide? In this paper, I treat suicide letters as a unique mode of testimony that can reveal some of the profound effects of workplace transformations on subjective, intimate and lived experiences of work. By examining French suicide testimonies, my aim is to deepen our understanding of the nature and causes of suicide in today's globalised workplaces.},

The SNH attempts to account for all intensities of depression based on standard evolutionary theories of sociality, communication and psychological pain. The SNH suggests that depression evolved to perform two complimentary social problem-solving functions. First, depression induces cognitive changes that focus and enhance capacities for the accurate analysis and solution of key social problems, suggesting a social rumination function. Second, the costs associated with the anhedonia and psychomotor perturbation of depression can persuade reluctant social partners to provide help or make concessions via two possible mechanisms, namely, honest signaling and passive, unintentional fitness extortion. Thus it may also have a social motivation function.},

There are many potential perpetrators, including spouses and partners, parents, other family members, neighbours, and men in positions of power or influence. Most forms of violence are not unique incidents but are ongoing, and can even continue for decades. Because of the sensitivity of the subject, violence is almost universally under-reported.

We hypothesize that these folk illnesses are distinct and that there is a stronger association between current levels of stress and depressive symptoms with past experience of nervios than with susto, because the cultural constructions of these folk illnesses reflect chronic and acute concepts of distress, respectively. Interviews were conducted in Guadalajara, Mexico, where participants responded to questions about their socio-demographic characteristics, stress, depressive symptoms, and whether they had experienced susto or nervios. Susto and nervios are very prevalent and occur across sociodemographic subgroups, with the exception that nervios occurred more often in women (p \textbackslash{} 0.05). Susto was significantly associated with stress and depressive symptoms (p \textbackslash{} 0.05), but nervios had a much stronger association (p \textbackslash{} 0.0001), even after controlling for gender. Susto and nervios were expressions of psychological distress; most of those with depression reported susto and/or nervios. This study validates the link between these folk illnesses and stress and depression and may, ultimately, facilitate crosscultural research on stress.},

Comparison of recall of key symptoms and longitudinal reports shows the accuracy of recall, not just reliability. Method. At age 25, 1003 members of the Christchurch Health and Development Study cohort were asked to recall key symptoms of depression (sadness, loss of interest) up to age 21. This recall was compared with longitudinal reports at ages 15, 16, 18 and 21 years. Diagnosis was by DSM-III-R and DSM-IV criteria. Results. Only 4 \% of those without previous reports recalled key symptoms. Of those with a diagnosis of depression up to age 21, 44\% recalled a key symptom. Measures of severity of an episode (number of symptoms, impairment, duration, suicidality) and chronicity (years with a diagnosis, years with suicidal ideation) all strongly predicted recall. Current key symptoms increased recall, even after taking account of severity and chronicity. Being female and receiving treatment also predicted recall, although odds ratios were reduced to 1.6\textendash 1.7 when all other predictors were included. Comparison of risk factors for key symptoms showed similar results from longitudinal reports and recall. Sexual abuse, neuroticism, lack of parental attachment, gender, physical abuse and maternal depression were major risk factors in both sets of analyses. Conclusions. Forgetting of prior episodes of depression was common. Severity, chronicity, current depression, gender and treatment predicted recall. Lifetime prevalence based on recall will be markedly underestimated but the identification of major risk factors may be relatively little impaired.},

After adjusting for dimorphism in size (height), adult males have greater total lean mass and mineral mass, and a lower fat mass than females. These whole-body differences are complemented by major differences in tissue distribution. Adult males have greater arm muscle mass, larger and stronger bones, and reduced limb fat, but a similar degree of central abdominal fat. Females have a more peripheral distribution of fat in early adulthood; however, greater parity and the menopause both induce a more android fat distribution with increasing age. Sex differences in body composition are primarily attributable to the action of sex steroid hormones, which drive the dimorphisms during pubertal development. Oestrogen is important not only in body fat distribution but also in the female pattern of bone development that predisposes to a greater female risk of osteoporosis in old age. Disorders of sex development are associated with significant abnormalities of body composition, attributable largely to their impact on mechanisms of hormonal regulation.},

This study aimed to describe population variability in body composition dimorphism, and to test whether annual temperature and proxies for population energy supply accounted for this variability. Methods: Data on sex-specific anthropometry (weight, stature, triceps, and subscapular skinfolds) and mean annual temperature were collated for 96 nonindustrialized populations. Lean mass and fat mass were calculated. Sexual dimorphism was expressed in sympercents. Sex-averaged skinfolds and stature were used as proxies for short-term and long-term energy supply, respectively. Results: All outcomes showed significant mean dimorphism except body mass index. The magnitude of dimorphism was not randomly distributed across global regions, being lowest in African and Asian populations and greatest in Arctic populations. There was a negative correlation across populations between lean mass dimorphism and adiposity dimorphism, independent of temperature. With decreasing temperature, dimorphism in both lean mass and adiposity increased. Dimorphism increased in fatter but not taller populations, independently of temperature. Conclusions: The inverse correlation between lean mass dimorphism and adiposity dimorphism indicates a sextrade-off between these two tissue accretion strategies. At colder temperatures, females invest disproportionately more in adiposity, and males disproportionately more in lean mass. Dimorphism also increased in proportion to proxies for short-term but not long-term energy availability. These findings suggest that phenotypic plasticity contributes to variability in body composition dimorphism, and that the occupation of dimorphic niches regarding reproductive energetics may be important.

For example, a table might show odds ratios for one or more exposures and also for several confounders from a single logistic regression. This can lead to mistaken interpretations of these estimates. We use causal diagrams to display the sources of the problems. Presentation of exposure and confounder effect estimates from a single model may lead to several interpretative difficulties, inviting confusion of direct-effect estimates with total-effect estimates for covariates in the model. These effect estimates may also be confounded even though the effect estimate for the main exposure is not confounded. Interpretation of these effect estimates is further complicated by heterogeneity (variation, modification) of the exposure effect measure across covariate levels. We offer suggestions to limit potential misunderstandings when multiple effect estimates are presented, including precise distinction between total and direct effect measures from a single model, and use of multiple models tailored to yield total-effect estimates for covariates.},

  abstract = {Hunter-gatherer mobility is not always related to the positioning of people for optimal exploitation of subsistence resources. Another essential reason for forager mobility is the establishment and maintenance of a network of social relations which provides a Xow of information among widely scattered social groups and functions as a ``safety net'' in situations of local resource scarcity. It is proposed that the frequency and spatial scale of such movement can be related to temporal and spatial patterns of variation in resource availability. Then, a general, heuristic model of the spatial organization of band-level foraging groups is developed within which to situate this kind of non-``utilitarian'' movement. This model ties ``informational'' and ``network'' mobility to minimal and maximal foraging bands and provides quantitative estimates of the spatial scales involved. The usefulness of the approach developed is illustrated with an evaluation of the archaeological data for the transport of ``exotic'' materials in the late Upper Paleolithic and Early Mesolithic periods in southwestern Germany. SigniWcant diVerences in the frequencies of transport of diVerent kinds of ``exotics'' have been observed between these periods. These diVerences can be explained within the framework of information on changing patterns of temporal and spatial resource availability and the models developed here.},

Data were analysed using logistic and ordinary least-squares regression. Confidence intervals were examined to see whether the effect of being female differed significantly between countries. In all countries, women had consistently worse physical functioning (both self-reported and objectively measured). Women also tended to report more difficulty with activities of daily living (ADL), although differences were not always significant. In general, sex differences across measures were less pronounced in China. In Korea, women had significantly lower grip strength, but sex differences in ADL difficulty were non-significant or even reversed. Education and marital status helped explain sex differences. Overall, there was striking similarity in the magnitude and direction of sex differences across countries despite considerable differences in context, although modest variations in the effect of sex were observed.},

While some researchers argue that these diagnoses cannot be differentiated, others insist that postpartum depression is distinct. The construct validity of the diagnosis ``postpartum depression'' is evaluated by critically reviewing the empirical evidence regarding prevalence, symptomatology, course, duration, relapse, and etiology. The literature suggests that women are at elevated risk for depression in the postpartum period. However, postpartum depressive episodes tend to be mild and to resolve quickly, which suggests that postpartum depression is best conceptualized as an adjustment disorder. Etiologically, postpartum depression is related to the same variables that predict nonpostpartum depression. These findings suggest that postpartum depression does not differ qualitatively from nonpostpartum depression. The implications of this conclusion for research and treatment are considered.},

Focusing on existing correlational (i.e., observational), genetically informed, and intervention (i.e., experimental) research on the association between relationship distress and depression, we conclude that the existing body of research evidence supports the claim that relationship distress is a causal risk factor for depression. A secondary aim of the article is to highlight a variety of effective methods that, when viewed from the perspective of triangulation, enhance the pursuit of causal inference, including propensity score matching, target trial emulation, directed acyclic graph approach, and Mendelian randomization.},

Studies written in English that included a measure of depression and IPV and compared these constructs across women of different cultural groups were included. Eleven studies with a total of 33,716 participants met all the inclusion criteria. While all studies found a relationship between IPV and depression, six found that there were significant differences in IPV and depression between cultures and five indicated that there was no significant difference in this relationship between cultures. The reviewed literature suggests that where there are cross-cultural differences in the relationship between IPV and depression, factors such as help-seeking behavior, individual coping strategies, racism, identity as a wife, and cultural values are likely to play a mediating role. Future research should examine the unique contribution of these factors in alleviating depression associated with IPV within cultural groups.},

  abstract = {Background We used data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2010 (GBD 2010) to estimate the burden of disease attributable to mental and substance use disorders in terms of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), years of life lost to premature mortality (YLLs), and years lived with disability (YLDs). Methods For each of the 20 mental and substance use disorders included in GBD 2010, we systematically reviewed epidemiological data and used a Bayesian meta-regression tool, DisMod-MR, to model prevalence by age, sex, country, region, and year. We obtained disability weights from representative community surveys and an internet-based survey to calculate YLDs. We calculated premature mortality as YLLs from cause of death estimates for 1980\textendash 2010 for 20 age groups, both sexes, and 187 countries. We derived DALYs from the sum of YLDs and YLLs. We adjusted burden estimates for comorbidity and present them with 95\% uncertainty intervals. Findings In 2010, mental and substance use disorders accounted for 183{$\cdot$}9 million DALYs (95\% UI 153{$\cdot$}5 million\textendash 216{$\cdot$}7 million), or 7{$\cdot$}4\% (6{$\cdot$}2\textendash 8{$\cdot$}6) of all DALYs worldwide. Such disorders accounted for 8{$\cdot$}6 million YLLs (6{$\cdot$}5 million\textendash 12{$\cdot$}1 million; 0{$\cdot$}5\% [0{$\cdot$}4\textendash 0{$\cdot$}7] of all YLLs) and 175{$\cdot$}3 million YLDs (144{$\cdot$}5 million\textendash 207{$\cdot$}8 million; 22{$\cdot$}9\% [18{$\cdot$}6\textendash 27{$\cdot$}2] of all YLDs). Mental and substance use disorders were the leading cause of YLDs worldwide. Depressive disorders accounted for 40{$\cdot$}5\% (31{$\cdot$}7\textendash 49{$\cdot$}2) of DALYs caused by mental and substance use disorders, with anxiety disorders accounting for 14{$\cdot$}6\% (11{$\cdot$}2\textendash 18{$\cdot$}4), illicit drug use disorders for 10{$\cdot$}9\% (8{$\cdot$}9\textendash 13{$\cdot$}2), alcohol use disorders for 9{$\cdot$}6\% (7{$\cdot$}7\textendash 11{$\cdot$}8), schizophrenia for 7{$\cdot$}4\% (5{$\cdot$}0\textendash 9{$\cdot$}8), bipolar disorder for 7{$\cdot$}0\% (4{$\cdot$}4\textendash 10{$\cdot$}3), pervasive developmental disorders for 4{$\cdot$}2\% (3{$\cdot$}2\textendash 5{$\cdot$}3), childhood behavioural disorders for 3{$\cdot$}4\% (2{$\cdot$}2\textendash 4{$\cdot$}7), and eating disorders for 1{$\cdot$}2\% (0{$\cdot$}9\textendash 1{$\cdot$}5). DALYs varied by age and sex, with the highest proportion of total DALYs occurring in people aged 10\textendash 29 years. The burden of mental and substance use disorders increased by 37{$\cdot$}6\% between 1990 and 2010, which for most disorders was driven by population growth and ageing. Interpretation Despite the apparently small contribution of YLLs\textemdash with deaths in people with mental disorders coded to the physical cause of death and suicide coded to the category of injuries under self-harm\textemdash our findings show the striking and growing challenge that these disorders pose for health systems in developed and developing regions. In view of the magnitude of their contribution, improvement in population health is only possible if countries make the prevention and treatment of mental and substance use disorders a public health priority.

  abstract = {We are not alone             Before the mid-20th century, it was generally assumed that culture, behavior learned from others, was specific to humans. However, starting with identification in a few species, evidence that animals can learn and transmit behaviors has accumulated at an ever-increasing pace. Today, there is no doubt that culture is widespread among animal species, both vertebrates and invertebrates, marine and terrestrial. Whiten reviews evidence for animal culture and elaborates on the wide array of forms that such culture takes. Recognizing that other species have complex and varied culture has implications for conservation and welfare and for understanding the evolution of this essential component of animal societies, including our own.                            Science               , this issue p.               eabe6514                        ,                             BACKGROUND               Culture\textemdash the inheritance of an array of behavioral traditions through social learning from others\textemdash was once thought specific to humans. Recent and accumulating evidence has shown that, to the contrary, culture permeates the lives of a great diversity of animals, with far-reaching implications for evolutionary biology, anthropology, and conservation. Early evidence for animal culture emerged in the mid\textendash 20th century in the discovery of regional birdsong dialects and the spread of provisioned sweet potato washing in Japanese monkeys. Stimulated by these discoveries, long-term studies of wild chimpanzees and orangutans later in the century revealed complex cultures composed of multiple traditions spanning diverse aspects of apes' lives, from tool use to social and sexual behavior.               In part through the accumulation of further long-term field studies, the present century has witnessed an explosion in discoveries about social learning and culture, not only in primates but also in a rapidly growing range of animal species, from cetaceans to a diverse array of birds, fish, and even invertebrates.                                         ADVANCES               Novel experimental designs have rigorously demonstrated the cultural transmission and spread of behavioral innovations introduced by researchers, both in the wild and in labs. New statistical methods have detected the signatures of behavioral innovations as they spread through social networks, identifying culture in species (e.g., whales) for which experiments are impractical. Through these and other methodological advances, the reach of cultural learning is now known to encompass an unexpected range of species, with surprising new discoveries extending even to insects, from bees to fruit flies.               The reach of culture has similarly been discovered to span diversity in behavioral domains, including foraging techniques, tool use, vocal communication, social customs and preferences for particular prey, migratory pathways, nesting sites, and mates. The revelation that cultural inheritance permeates many species' lives is increasingly recognized to have profound implications for evolutionary biology at large, because it provides a second form of inheritance that builds on the primary genetic inheritance system, facilitating cultural evolution. The two inheritance systems may generate rich interactive effects, as they have in humans.               A plethora of innovative experiments has further identified an array of cognitive processes involved in learning from others, ranging from simple and ubiquitous forms to specialized ones such as imitation and teaching. These forms of social learning have been shown to be further refined through a variety of selective biases, such as conforming to majorities or copying particularly skilled elders.                                         OUTLOOK               United Nations bodies operating under the aegis of international conventions have recently recognized the importance of all that has been discovered about animal cultures, for conservation policies and practices. Among sperm whales and chimpanzees, specific cultural entities, as opposed to genetically defined units, have been recognized as meriting conservation in their own right. This finding, in turn, urges a greater focus on understanding cultural phenomena in the wild. The task of rigorously identifying social learning has relied heavily on controlled experiments in captivity, but field experiments are increasingly carried out. These and other innovative methods to identify and trace animal cultures in the wild deserve to be developed and applied further to wild populations.               The wealth of methodological advances and empirical discoveries about animal cultures in the present century provides an exciting foundation from which to explore deeper questions. Do animal cultures evolve, cumulatively, as human cultures have done so impressively over past millennia? How profoundly does the lifetime reach of culture in animals' lives reshape our understanding of behavioral ecology and the fundamentals of evolution at large? How close are human and animal cultures now perceived to be, and where do the principal differences remain?                                                   Diversity in cultural species and behavioral domains.

(                     B                     ) Female fruit flies (left) that witness a male marked with one of two colors mating (top right) later prefer to mate with similarly colored males. This behavior is further copied by others, initiating a tradition. (                     C                     ) Bighorn sheep translocated to unfamiliar locations were initially sedentary, but spring migration and skill in reaching higher-altitude grazing grounds expanded over decades, implicating intergenerational cultural transmission.

Later, when offered these options with no distasteful additive, both na\"ive infants and immigrating adult males adopted the experimentally created local group preference. (                     E                     ) Young meerkats learn scorpion predation because adults initially supply live prey with stingers removed and later provide unmodified prey as the young meerkats mature. (                     F                     ) A humpback whale innovation of slapping the sea surface to refine predation, known as ``lobtail feeding,'' spread over two decades to create a new tradition in hundreds of other humpbacks.

This cultural form of inheritance was once thought specific to humans, but research over the past 70 years has instead revealed it to be widespread in nature, permeating the lives of a diversity of animals, including all major classes of vertebrates. Recent studies suggest that culture's reach may extend also to invertebrates\textemdash notably, insects. In the present century, the reach of animal culture has been found to extend across many different behavioral domains and to rest on a suite of social learning processes facilitated by a variety of selective biases that enhance the efficiency and adaptiveness of learning. Far-reaching implications, for disciplines from evolutionary biology to anthropology and conservation policies, are increasingly being explored.},

This aspect of stylistic behavior is founded on the basic human cognitive process of identification via comparison. Such stylistic behavior is argued to be one means by which people negotiate their personal and social identities relative to that of surrounding others. Thus, the process of social, and corresponding stylistic, comparison is proposed as the mechanism underlying stylistic development and change. This behavioral basis for style is explicated in a case study among the Kalahari San, in which the role of style in beaded headbands in regional, areal, and personal identity relations, as well as exchange, is investigated. Finally, the proposed behavioral basis for style is discussed in terms of what it can contribute to interpretation of variability in material culture, current approaches to style, and its implications for the development of a theory of style.},

I will propose on the basis of qualitative and quantitative data that (1) all four hypotheses identify benefits that are gained by Ju/'hoansi through producing and distributing a surplus of meat, (2) different benefits might be important at different stages of a man's life, and (3) the pursuit of broader political goals merits serious consideration in accounting for men's work effort.

Cross-cultural studies establish the universality of shamanic practices in hunter-gatherer societies around the world and across time. These universal principles of shamanism reflect underlying neurological processes and provide a basis for an evolutionary theology. The shamanic paradigm involves basic brain processes, neurognostic structures, and innate brain modules. This approach reveals that universals of shamanism such as animism, totemism, soul flight, animal spirits, and death-and-rebirth experiences reflect fundamental brain operations and structures of consciousness. The shamanic paradigm can contribute to a reconciliation of scientific and religious perspectives by providing a universalistic biopsychosocial framework that explicates the biological underpinnings of spiritual experiences and practices and provides a basis for neurotheology and evolutionary theology approaches.},

  abstract = {The nature\textendash nurture debate is one that biologists often dismiss as a false dichotomy, as all phenotypic traits are the results of complex processes of gene and environment interactions. However, such dismissiveness belies the ongoing debate that is unmistakable throughout the biological and social sciences concerning the role of biological influences in the development of psychological and behavioral traits in humans. Many have proposed that this debate is due to ideologically driven biases in the interpretation of results. Those favoring biological approaches have been accused of a greater willingness to accept biological explanations so as to rationalize or justify the status quo of inequality. Those rejecting biological approaches have been accused of an unwillingness to accept biological explanations so as to attribute inequalities solely to social and institutional factors, ultimately allowing for the possibility of social equality. While it is important to continue to investigate this topic through further research and debate, another approach is to examine the degree to which the allegations of bias are indeed valid. To accomplish this, a convenience sample of individuals with relevant postgraduate degrees was recruited from Mechanical Turk and social media. Participants were asked to rate the inferential power of different research designs and of mock results that varied in the degree to which they supported different ideologies. Results were suggestive that researchers harbor sincere differences of opinion concerning the inferential value of relevant research. There was no suggestion that ideological confirmation biases drive these differences. However, challenges associated with recruiting a large enough sample of experts as well as identifying believable mock scenarios limit the study's inferential scope.},

  abstract = {Gut microbiome diversity has been strongly associated with mood-relating behaviours, including major depressive disorder (MDD). This association stems from the recently characterised bi-directional communication system between the gut and the brain, mediated by neuroimmune, neuroendocrine and sensory neural pathways. While the link between gut microbiome and depression is well supported by research, a major question needing to be addressed is the causality in the connection between the two, which will support the understanding of the role that the gut microbiota play in depression. In this article, we address this question by examining a theoretical `chronology', reviewing the evidence supporting two possible sequences of events. First, we discuss that alterations in the gut microbiota populations of specific species might contribute to depression, and secondly, that depressive states might induce modification of specific gut microbiota species and eventually contribute to more severe depression. The feasibility of both sequences is supported by pre-clinical trials. For instance, research in rodents has shown an onset of depressive behaviour following faecal transplantations from patients with MDD. On the other hand, mental induction of stress and depressive behaviour in rodents resulted in reduced gut microbiota richness and diversity. Synthesis of these chronology dynamics raises important research directions to further understand the role that gut microbiota play in mood-relating behaviours, which holds substantial potential clinical outcomes for persons who experience MDD or related depressive disorders.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review describes evolving concepts and recent data on the relationship between serum testosterone levels and normal and disordered sleep. RECENT FINDINGS: Sex-related differences in circadian rhythms and sleep physiology are in part due to organizational and activational effects of sex steroids. Testosterone affects the organization of circadian rhythms and the timing, but not the duration, of sleep. Increasing testosterone during puberty leads to later bedtimes. The diurnal variation in testosterone depends on sleep rather than circadian rhythm or season. Pubertal onset is heralded, well before virilization, by a luteinizing hormone level at least 3.7{$\mkern1mu$}U/l during sleep. Total sleep deprivation lowers testosterone, but sleep restriction only does so if it occurs in the first half of the night. The recovery of testosterone from sleep disruption is impaired in old as compared with young rodents. In men with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), low testosterone is related to obesity rather than the OSA itself, and improves with weight loss but inconsistently with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Testosterone treatment only transiently worsens severity of OSA, which need not be considered a contraindication to its use. SUMMARY: Testosterone treatment is unlikely to benefit sleep in men with secondary hypogonadism, for example due to obesity or depression, in contrast to the management of the underlying abnormality.},

  abstract = {Background: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder primarily affecting social function and communication. Recently, there has been an interest in whether people with ASD also show memory deficits. Studies in ASD have revealed subtle impairments on tasks requiring participants to learn new information (episodic memory), but intact performance on general knowledge tasks (semantic memory). The novelty of this study was to explore metamemory (i.e., awareness of memory performance) and to examine whether children with ASD suffer from a generalized metamemory deficit common to all forms of memory, or would only present deficits on episodic metamemory tasks. Method: To assess metamemory functioning we administered 2 feeling-of-knowing (FOK) tasks, 1 for episodic and 1 for semantic materials. In these tasks, participants are asked to predict the likelihood of subsequently recognizing currently unrecalled information. Results: It was found that children with autism made inaccurate FOK predictions, but only for episodic materials. Conclusion: A specific deficit in meta-cognition emerges for only one set of materials. We argue that this deficit can be conceived of as reflecting a deficit in recollection, stemming from an inability to cast the self in the past and retrieve information about the study episode.

Somatization is commonly found in Asian countries, but it is not properly assessed by existing Westernized depression assessment tools. In addition, cultural factors were shown to shape abused women's ways of adaptive coping.

In this paper, we address why shifts in kin coresidence patterns may arise in the later years of a marriage, after the birth of children. To do so, we model the inclusive fitness costs that wives might experience from leaving their own kin and joining their husband's kin as a function of the number of children in their nuclear family. Our model suggests that such shifts should become less costly to wives as their families grow. This simple model may help explain some of the dynamics of postmarital residence among the Hadza and offer insight into the dynamics of multilocal residence, the most prevalent form of postmarital residence among foragers.},

  abstract = {Background Symptoms of social anxiety rise rapidly during adolescence, particularly for girls. Pervasive displays of parental negative affect may increase adolescents' fear of negative evaluation (FNE), thereby increasing risk for social anxiety symptoms. Adolescent displays of negative affect may also exacerbate parents' social anxiety symptoms (via FNE of their child or their parenting skills), yet little research has tested transactional pathways of transmission in families. By early adolescence, rates of parent\textendash child conflict rise, and offspring become increasingly independent in their own displays of negative affect, increasing opportunities for hypothesized transactional pathways between parent\textendash adolescent displays of negative affect and social anxiety symptoms. Methods This study included 129 parents and daughters (11\textendash 13; no baseline social anxiety disorder), two-thirds of whom were at high risk for social anxiety due to a shy/fearful temperament. We used actor\textendash partner interdependence models (APIM) to test whether displays of negative facial affect, assessed individually for each parent and daughter during a conflict discussion, would predict their partner's social anxiety symptoms two years later. Automated facial affect coding assessed the frequency of negative affect during the discussion. Clinician ratings of social anxiety symptoms were completed at baseline and two-year follow-up. Results Both parents and daughters who displayed more frequent negative facial affect at baseline had partners with higher follow-up social anxiety symptoms, an effect that was maintained after accounting for actors' and partners' baseline symptoms. Conclusions Findings are consistent with intergenerational models positing that parental negative affective behaviors increase risk for adolescent social anxiety symptoms but also suggest that adolescent negative facial affect may exacerbate parental social anxiety symptoms. These bidirectional effects improve understanding of how social anxiety is maintained within a transactional family structure and highlight that displays of negative affect during parent\textendash adolescent interaction may warrant future examination as a potential treatment target for adolescent social anxiety.},

Second, we followed women with remitted MDD prospectively to determine if the attentional biases retrospectively associated with MDD history would predict MDD recurrence across a two-year follow-up. We found that women who spent a greater proportion of time looking at angry faces during the dot-probe task at the baseline assessment had a significantly shorter time to MDD onset.

This paper nevertheless evaluates the hypothesis that intergroup aggression evolved according to the same functional principles in the two species\textemdash selection favoring a tendency to kill members of neighboring groups when killing could be carried out safely. According to this idea chimpanzees and humans are equally risk-averse when fighting. When self-sacrificial war practices are found in humans, therefore, they result from cultural systems of reward, punishment, and coercion rather than evolved adaptations to greater risk-taking. To test this ``chimpanzee model,'' we review intergroup fighting in chimpanzees and nomadic huntergatherers living with other nomadic hunter-gatherers as neighbors. Whether humans have evolved specific psychological adaptations for war is unknown, but current evidence suggests that the chimpanzee model is an appropriate starting point for analyzing the biological and cultural evolution of warfare.},

  abstract = {Two major types of aggression, proactive and reactive, are associated with contrasting expression, eliciting factors, neural pathways, development, and function. The distinction is useful for understanding the nature and evolution of human aggression. Compared with many primates, humans have a high propensity for proactive aggression, a trait shared with chimpanzees but not bonobos. By contrast, humans have a low propensity for reactive aggression compared with chimpanzees, and in this respect humans are more bonobo-like. The bimodal classification of human aggression helps solve two important puzzles. First, a long-standing debate about the significance of aggression in human nature is misconceived, because both positions are partly correct. The Hobbes\textendash Huxley position rightly recognizes the high potential for proactive violence, while the Rousseau\textendash Kropotkin position correctly notes the low frequency of reactive aggression. Second, the occurrence of two major types of human aggression solves the execution paradox, concerned with the hypothesized effects of capital punishment on self-domestication in the Pleistocene. The puzzle is that the propensity for aggressive behavior was supposedly reduced as a result of being selected against by capital punishment, but capital punishment is itself an aggressive behavior. Since the aggression used by executioners is proactive, the execution paradox is solved to the extent that the aggressive behavior of which victims were accused was frequently reactive, as has been reported. Both types of killing are important in humans, although proactive killing appears to be typically more frequent in war. The biology of proactive aggression is less well known and merits increased attention.},

  abstract = {Background: The Patient Health Questionnaire depression module (PHQ-9) is a brief (10 items) screening and monitoring measure designed for use in primary care settings that operationalizes most of the DSM-IV and ICD-9 diagnostic criteria for major depression. In the United States, the PHQ-9 has become the recommended depression measure in primary care settings. However, there are no published reports of its use in developing countries and no reports of the feasibility of using the Spanish version of the PHQ-9 to screen for depression., Method: During a medical brigade in October 2001, we tested the feasibility of using the Spanish PHQ-9 to screen for major depression in primary care clinics. A team of U.S. and Honduran physicians and medical students assessed 199 mothers of children under 10 years of age as part of a depression prevalence study in 5 rural sites., Results: The PHQ-9 proved easy to administer to this population of poor, rural, young, and mostly illiterate Honduran women who had never participated in research before. Rater training required about 30 minutes of instruction for this group of physicians and medical students, plus occasional questions on the first day of use. Duration of administration of the PHQ-9 by interview ranged from 3 to 15 minutes. No items required major modification for cultural differences. The PHQ-9 identified a rate of 15\% for major depression in this sample, and the PHQ-9 results showed a sensitivity of 77\% and a specificity of 100\% compared with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV mood disorders module., Conclusion: Like the English PHQ-9, the Spanish PHQ-9 is an efficient and reliable screening measure for major depression in primary care. It is useful as a research measure for estimating the prevalence of major depression and as an aid to the primary care clinician in rural Honduras.},

  abstract = {A finalist for the Pulitzer Prize and the American Book Award, hailed in The Washington Post as "a work of enormous imagination and enterprise" and in The New York Times as "an important, original book," Southern Honor revolutionized our understanding of the antebellum South, revealing how Southern men adopted an ancient honor code that shaped their society from top to bottom. Using legal documents, letters, diaries, and newspaper columns, Wyatt-Brown offers fascinating examples to illuminate the dynamics of Southern life throughout the antebellum period. He describes how Southern whites, living chiefly in small, rural, agrarian surroundings, in which everyone knew everyone else, established the local hierarchy of kinfolk and neighbors according to their individual and familial reputation. By claiming honor and dreading shame, they controlled their slaves, ruled their households, established the social rankings of themselves, kinfolk, and neighbors, and responded ferociously against perceived threats. The shamed and shameless sometimes suffered grievously for defying community norms. Wyatt-Brown further explains how a Southern elite refined the ethic. Learning, gentlemanly behavior, and deliberate rather than reckless resort to arms softened the cruder form, which the author calls "primal honor." In either case, honor required men to demonstrate their prowess and engage in fierce defense of individual, family, community, and regional reputation by duel, physical encounter, or war. Subordination of African-Americans was uppermost in this Southern ethic. Any threat, whether from the slaves themselves or from outside agitation, had to be met forcefully. Slavery was the root cause of the Civil War, but, according to Wyatt-Brown, honor pulled the trigger. Featuring a new introduction by the author, this anniversary edition of a classic work offers readers a compelling view of Southern culture before the Civil War.},

However, little is known about how the gut virome, microbiome, and fecal metabolome change, and how they interact in MDD. Here, using whole-genome shotgun metagenomic and untargeted metabolomic methods, we identified 3 bacteriophages, 47 bacterial species, and 50 fecal metabolites showing notable differences in abundance between MDD patients and healthy controls (HCs). Patients with MDD were mainly characterized by increased abundance of the genus Bacteroides and decreased abundance of the genera Blautia and Eubacterium. These multilevel omics alterations generated a characteristic MDD coexpression network. Disturbed microbial genes and fecal metabolites were consistently mapped to amino acid ({$\gamma$}-aminobutyrate, phenylalanine, and tryptophan) metabolism. Furthermore, we identified a combinatorial marker panel that robustly discriminated MDD from HC individuals in both the discovery and validation sets. Our findings provide a deep insight into understanding of the roles of disturbed gut ecosystem in MDD. Major depressive disorder is linked with disturbances of gut bacterial, viral, and metabolic signatures.

  abstract = {Affect is involved in many psychological phenomena, but a descriptive structure, long sought, has been elusive. Valence and arousal are fundamental, and a key question-the focus of the present study-is the relationship between them. Valence is sometimes thought to be independent of arousal, but, in some studies (representing too few societies in the world) arousal was found to vary with valence. One common finding is that arousal is lowest at neutral valence and increases with both positive and negative valence: a symmetric V-shaped relationship. In the study reported here of self-reported affect during a remembered moment (N = 8,590), we tested the valence-arousal relationship in 33 societies with 25 different languages. The two most common hypotheses in the literature-independence and a symmetric V-shaped relationship-were not supported. With data of all samples pooled, arousal increased with positive but not negative valence. Valence accounted for between 5\% (Finland) and 43\% (China Beijing) of the variance in arousal. Although there is evidence for a structural relationship between the two, there is also a large amount of variability in this relation. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved).},

  abstract = {Background: Cannabis use is common among individuals of reproductive age. We examined publicly posted questions about perinatal cannabis use and licensed United States health care provider responses. Materials and Methods: Data were medical questions on perinatal cannabis use posted online from March 2011 to January 2017 on an anonymous digital health platform. Posters were able to ``thank'' health care providers for their responses and providers could ``agree'' with other provider responses. We characterized 364 user questions and 596 responses from 277 unique providers and examined endorsement of responses through provider ``agrees'' and user ``thanks.'' Results: The most frequent questions concerned prenatal cannabis use detection (24.7\%), effects on fertility (22.6\%), harms of prenatal use to the fetus (21.3\%), and risks of baby exposure to cannabis through breast milk (14.4\%). Provider sentiment in responses regarding the safety of perinatal cannabis use were coded as 55.6\% harmful, 8.8\% safe, 8.8\% mixed/unsure, and 26.8\% safety unaddressed. Half of providers (49.6\%) discouraged perinatal cannabis use, 0.5\% encouraged use, and 49.9\% neither encouraged nor discouraged use. Provider responses received 1,004 provider ``agrees'' and 583 user ``thanks.'' Provider responses indicating that perinatal cannabis use is unsafe received more provider ``agrees'' than responses indicating that use is safe (B = 0.42, 95\% CI 0.02\textendash 0.82, p = 0.04). User ``thanks'' did not differ by provider responses regarding safety or dis/ encouragement. Conclusion: The data indicate public interest in cannabis use effects before, during, and after pregnancy. While most health care providers indicated cannabis use during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not safe, many did not address safety or discourage use, suggesting a missed educational opportunity.},

This study investigated the association among the ratio of female to male depressive disorder rates, gross domestic product, the GINI Index, and the gender inequality index for 122 countries. The research yielded some major findings. First, there exists a significant correlation between gender inequality and gender disparities in mental health. Second, the GINI index is significantly associated with male\textemdash but not female\textemdash depressive disorder rates. Third, gender disparities in depressive disorders are associated with a country's wealth. These findings can help to inform society, policy-makers, and clinicians to improve the overall health level globally.},

Four different versions of the medical model are described and compared with respect to these dimensions. The medical models vary in several ways, but all can be considered ``essentialistic.'' As a counter to the essentialist homogeneity among the medical models, two nominalist analyses of psychiatric classification are reviewed. In order to fill out the space defined by the conceptual dimensions, two alternatives to medical model approaches are also described. After making some suggestions about where DSM-V might best be aligned with respect to the conceptual dimensions, the authors review the distinction between empirical and nonempirical aspects of classification\textemdash and argue that nonempirical aspects of classification are legitimate and necessary.},

These costs and benefits should differ depending on individuals' biological condition, thus disgust sensitivity may depend on an individual's condition as well. Hand grip strength (HGS) is a measure of biological condition, that's been shown to correlate with many aspects related to current and future health. Thus, the aim of the study was to test if HGS predicts disgust sensitivity across three functionally specialized domains (pathogen, sexual, moral) in two separate studies. Study 1 included 132 healthy men and 90 women. Study 2 included 182 healthy women. In both studies, HGS was measured and disgust sensitivity was evaluated with the Three Domain Disgust Scale. Age and BMI were controlled and, additionally, in Study 2 health markers (hsCRP, IL-6), self-perceived attractiveness, cortisol and testosterone were controlled. Study 1 showed that HGS was negatively related with pathogen and sexual disgust, and HGS explained sex differences in sexual disgust domain. Study 2 confirmed this result for women, when controlled for potential confounders. When controlled for HGS, sexual disgust was also negatively related with women's age, muscle mass and self-perceived attractiveness.},

  abstract = {What are the social signals of emotional tears? This question has fascinated scholars ever since Darwin. Studies have suggested several interpersonal effects of emotional tears. A recent article presented evidence in three studies that tearful individuals are not only perceived as warmer but also less competent than their non-tearful counterparts. However, the competence effect was relatively small, and a recent replication failed to find such an effect in two different populations while the warmth effect was replicated. This questions the generalizability of the effect of tears on perceived competence. To test whether individuals expressing emotional tears are really perceived as less competent and what boundary conditions such an effect might have, we specified a decision tree of three different studies in which we test differences between the original reference study and the replication. We replicated previous findings of the perceived (in)competence in Study 1 (n = 531) but observed a considerably smaller nonsignificant effect when proceeding to Study 2 (n = 471), which increased the number of stimuli. The earlier and now repeated replication failure can therefore likely be attributed to an increased variation in stimulus material. We conclude that there is not enough evidence to argue that one social outcome of tears signals a relative lack of competence as the effect seems to depend on the specific stimuli used.},

  abstract = {Tearful crying is a ubiquitous and likely uniquely human phenomenon. Scholars have argued that emotional tears serve an attachment function: Tears are thought to act as a social glue by evoking social support intentions. Initial experimental studies supported this proposition across several methodologies, but these were conducted almost exclusively on participants from North America and Europe, resulting in limited generalizability. This project examined the tears-social support intentions effect and possible mediating and moderating variables in a fully pre-registered study across 7007 participants (24,886 ratings) and 41 countries spanning all populated continents. Participants were presented with four pictures out of 100 possible targets with or without digitally-added tears. We confirmed the main prediction that seeing a tearful individual elicits the intention to support, d~=~0.49 [0.43, 0.55]. Our data suggest that this effect could be mediated by perceiving the crying target as warmer and more helpless, feeling more connected, as well as feeling more empathic concern for the crier, but not by an increase in personal distress of the observer. The effect was moderated by the situational valence, identifying the target as part of one's group, and trait empathic concern. A neutral situation, high trait empathic concern, and low identification increased the effect. We observed high heterogeneity across countries that was, via split-half validation, best explained by country-level GDP per capita and subjective well-being with stronger effects for higher-scoring countries. These findings suggest that tears can function as social glue, providing one possible explanation why emotional crying persists into adulthood.},

A burgeoning literature in psychology and social science argues that trait covariation should be similarly organised across individuals within human populations. Here we describe why extrapolating from inter-species to inter-individual trait covariation is not generally appropriate. The process that genetically tailors species to their environments (i.e. Darwinian evolution) is fundamentally different from processes that tailor individuals to their environments (e.g. developmental plasticity), so their outcomes in terms of trait covariation need not be parallel or even related. We discuss why correlational selection, physical linkage, pleiotropy, and non-random mating do not substantively affect this claim in the context of complex human traits. We also discuss life history trade-offs and their relation to inter-individual trait covariation. We conclude that researchers should avoid hypotheses and explanations that assume trait covariation will correspond across and within species, unless they can mount a theoretically coherent argument to support this claim in the context of their research question.},

This presents a Darwinian paradox: why has SSB been maintained despite apparent selection against it? We show that genetic effects associated with SSB may, in individuals who only engage in opposite-sex sexual behaviour (OSB individuals), confer a mating advantage. Using results from a recent genome-wide association study of SSB and a new genome-wide association study on number of opposite-sex sexual partners in 358,426 individuals, we show that, among OSB individuals, genetic effects associated with SSB are associated with having more opposite-sex sexual partners. Computer simulations suggest that such a mating advantage for alleles associated with SSB could help explain how it has been evolutionarily maintained.

  abstract = {Life-history theory predicts that access to limited resources leads to trade-offs between competing body functions. Women, who face higher costs of reproduction when compared to men, should be especially vulnerable to these trade-offs. We propose the `cognitive costs of reproduction hypothesis', which states that energy trade-offs imposed by reproduction may lead to a decline in maternal cognitive function during gestation. In particular, we hypothesize that the decline in cognitive function frequently observed during pregnancy is associated with the allocation of resources between the competing energetic requirements of the mother's brain and the developing foetus. Several distinctive anatomical and physiological features including a high metabolic rate of the brain, large infant size, specific anatomical features of the placenta and trophoblast, and the lack of maternal control over glucose flow through the placenta make the occurrence of these trade-offs likely. Herein, we review several lines of evidence for trade-offs between gestation and cognition that are related to: (i) energy metabolism during reproduction; (ii) energy metabolism of the human brain; (iii) links between energy metabolism and cognitive function; and (iv) links between gestation and cognitive function. We also review evidence for the important roles of cortisol, corticotropin-releasing hormone and sex hormones in mediating the effects of gestation on cognition, and we discuss possible neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the observed effects. The evidence supports the view that energy trade-offs between foetal growth and maternal endocrine and brain function lead to changes in maternal cognition, and that this phenomenon is mediated by neuroendocrine mechanisms involving the hypothalamic\textendash pituitary\textendash adrenal axis, brainstem nucleus locus coeruleus and hippocampus.},

  abstract = {Three studies examined the relationship between psychological entitlement and anger in the context of bad luck. Anger is often described as an emotion that arises when a person experiences a negative outcome for which someone else was responsible. Simple bad luck, without an intentional agent clearly responsible for one's misfortune, should therefore not usually engender anger. However, we predicted that individuals higher in psychological entitlement, with their high expectations for personal outcomes and tendency to moralize them, would be more likely to experience anger after bad luck as compared to individuals lower in psychological entitlement. We found that psychological entitlement was, indeed, positively correlated with anger after bad luck, and with perceptions of injustice (Study 1). The relationship between entitlement and anger was specific to personally-experienced bad luck; entitlement was not correlated with anger when people recalled an unfair event (Study 2), or when they imagined that bad luck happened to someone else (Study 3).},

  abstract = {Objective To present nationally representative data on prevalence and correlates of MDD by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSMIV) criteria, and on study patterns and correlates of treatment and treatment adequacy from the recently completed National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R). Design Face-to-face household survey conducted from February 2001 to December 2002. Setting The 48 contiguous United States. Participants Household residents ages 18 years or older (N=9090) who responded to the NCS-R survey. Main Outcome Measures Prevalence and correlates of MDD using the World Health Organization's (WHO) Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), 12-month severity with the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology SelfReport (QIDS-SR), the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), and the WHO disability assessment scale (WHO-DAS). Clinical reinterviews used the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. Results The prevalence of CIDI MDD for lifetime was 16.2\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 15.1-17.3) (32.6-35.1 million US adults) and for 12-month was 6.6\% (95\% CI, 5.9-7.3) (13.1-14.2 million US adults). Virtually all CIDI 12-month cases were independently classified as clinically significant using the QIDS-SR, with 10.4\% mild, 38.6\% moderate, 38.0\% severe, and 12.9\% very severe. Mean episode duration was 16 weeks (95\% CI, 15.1-17.3). Role impairment as measured by SDS was substantial as indicated by 59.3\% of 12-month cases with severe or very severe role impairment. Most lifetime (72.1\%) and 12-month (78.5\%) cases had comorbid CIDI/DSM-IV disorders, with MDD only rarely primary. Although 51.6\% (95\% CI, 46.1-57.2) of 12-month cases received health care treatment for MDD, treatment was adequate in only 41.9\% (95\% CI, 35.947.9) of these cases, resulting in 21.7\% (95\% CI, 18.1-25.2) of 12-month MDD being adequately treated. Sociodemographic correlates of treatment were far less numerous than those of prevalence. Conclusions Major depressive disorder is a common disorder, widely distributed in the population, and usually associated with substantial symptom severity and role impairment. While the recent increase in treatment is encouraging, inadequate treatment is a serious concern. Emphasis on screening and expansion of treatment needs to be accompanied by a parallel emphasis on treatment quality improvement.},

I argue that such an approach builds on earlier feminist critiques of psychiatry, but provides a more nuanced explanation of how social factors can affect women's mental health by emphasizing that women with depression are not merely passive victims of oppressive social practices, but rather that these women are actively responding to their environment and interpreting their own experiences.},
